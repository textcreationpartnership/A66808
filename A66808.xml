            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I publiſhed my Book of <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw,</hi> I thought it was the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice I could do for my Countrey, ſince I found it even in Twenty years experience to be eminently ſucceſsful in the Cure of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Diſeaſes, which had reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Rational Methods, that had been uſed either by my ſelf, or others of my Faculty. In that Book I treat of the Conſtituent Principles of that Water, viz. <hi>Iron, Vitriol, Alome, Nitre,</hi> and <hi>Salt.</hi> And then for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſake, I diſcourſe concerning the
<pb facs="tcp:99554:4"/>Original Cauſe of every ſort of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>Sea, Rain, Snow, Lake, Pond, Fenne, Spring,</hi> and <hi>River Water,</hi> and more at large I handle the Controverſie among Philoſophers both Ancient and Modern about the <hi>Original of Springs.</hi> I then proceed to treat of <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> with the property of the Minerals which that Spring has imbibed; and conclude with a Deſcription of the Nature and Vertues of <hi>that Spaw,</hi> and of the Cures done by the Water; which I did recite upon my own Reputation in my Firſt Edition. And that being ſold, the Report of the Vertues of the Spaw, I thought fit to confirm in the Second Impreſsion by the Atteſtation of ſeveral Perſons of Honour and Quality yet living, on whom the like Cures were done in their ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who for Publique Good, did willingly allow the mention of their
<pb facs="tcp:99554:4"/>Names: not doubting but it would find acceptance among Ingenuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and indeed ſo it did, for I have had hearty thanks from many of the <hi>beſt Rank,</hi> both <hi>Philoſophers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi> and <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of late I have met with a Check in a Book called <hi>Hydrologia Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſet forth by <hi>William Simpſon, Philo-Chymico-Medicus;</hi> which I rather think merits the Title of <hi>PY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROLOGIA MIMICA,</hi> ſince his main buſineſs is to treat of Chymical Experiments prepared out of <hi>Fire,</hi> which he borrows from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; beſides that he <hi>ſpits Fire</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Page. He pretends to deny the ſaid Principles of the Spring (though he aſſerts the Vertues thereof) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages in the Diſpute about the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Springs. All which if he had managed like a Scholar by dint of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for the diſcovery of Truth in
<pb facs="tcp:99554:5"/>each particular, it might have been for his Credit, and ſhould never have been diſguſted by me. But inſtead of that He ſets his Wits on the Rack on every account to beſpatter me with rude and uncivil Language, even without any Ground or Reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I willingly ſubmit to the Judgement of the Reader.</p>
            <p>But who am I that I may not bear it, when the moſt <hi>Famous Vniverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in the World, and all the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> do not eſcape a ſevere Cenſure concerning their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, from the malevolent Pen of this bare Batchelour of Arts: and all the Learned Phyſicians in the World, and their Rational Method of Phyſick, muſt be undervalued as trivial and ſucceſsleſs, meerly to make way for a few Chymical Medicines of his own.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have been adviſed by ſeveral Learned Gentlemen of my
<pb facs="tcp:99554:5"/>Friends, to let him alone, and not to honour him with an Anſwer; who urged to me that Example of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> who being told that a mean Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had writ ſaucily againſt him, anſwered, <hi>Relatum eſt mihi, Scara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeum quendam contra me ſcribere, cui reſpondere nec dignitatis eſt nec Otii.</hi> I have been told (ſaid he) that a certain <hi>Scarabee</hi> has writ againſt me, to whom it doth neither become me, nor have I leiſure to give Anſwer. But I could not be ſo ſatisfied, to let the young man go on in ſuch a Carier without a Curb, ſince I have writ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what I am aſſured to be true, and am well able to defend againſt all his Objections. Although I confeſs I am not at very good leaſure to do it, in rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of my other Occaſions; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince I am hereby interrupted in my Latine Copy upon the Subject of the Spaw, which I thought ſhould have
<pb facs="tcp:99554:6"/>ſeen the light this year. Nor do I know of any one elſe, that is ſo much concerned to undertake it.</p>
            <p>I therefore took his Book into Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, concerning which I muſt ſay as once <hi>Julian</hi> did upon a better thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in which <hi>ſunt bona, ſunt quaedam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocria, ſunt mala plura.</hi> Or as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Beſides his words, which are his own, ſtuft with bombaſte, I ſee nothing in it, but what is vulgar. Thoſe indeed are ſuch and ſo affected, wherein I find him conſtantly incircled, as if like <hi>Fauſtus</hi> he went about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure up <hi>Mephiſtophiles.</hi> Or as if the <hi>Chymical Spirits</hi> were like the <hi>Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> that they will not be raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hard and big words. His <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments</hi> which are not a few, are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged out of <hi>Kircher, Helmont, Zwelfer, Sennertus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,
<pb facs="tcp:99554:6"/>Sendivogius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>French</hi> his Book of <hi>Knaresbrough Spaw,</hi> and ſeveral others, though he is rarely ſo candid as to own them. The Inferences which thence he deduces are moſt what upon miſtaken grounds, drawing general Concluſions from particular Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. His <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is not at all to be liked, being altogether novel and precarious. His <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity</hi> leſs; <hi>Defamation</hi> being the main Topick of all his Diſcourſes. I wiſh for (his own ſake) his <hi>Divinity</hi> may be better; for I have ſeldom ſeen any one ſo Sceptical in Reaſon, but the ſame has been Heterodox, if not <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> in Religion.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord Cook</hi> ſays there are two things that marres many a Lawyer, to wit <hi>Praepoſtera Lectio &amp; praepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera Praxis.</hi> Give me leave to apply it to Phyſicians, and particularly to this my Antagoniſt. It does appear he
<pb facs="tcp:99554:7"/>fell among ill Books, and read <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Authors</hi> in Phyſick, or elſe he began at the wrong end; read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Therapeutick</hi> part, before he underſtood <hi>Phyſiology</hi> and <hi>Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi> otherwiſe his parts well laid would have rendred him far more uſeful in his Country, than now he is likely to be; as for the later, <hi>viz. Praepropera Praxis,</hi> he is at leiſure enough for that, ſave only in his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory. I confeſs I never ſaw any man ſo <hi>big with himſelf,</hi> that like the <hi>Frog in the Fable</hi> he is ready to burſt, either through <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Envy;</hi> if I could now help with a piece of good Midwifery, and bring him to a ſafe Delivery, he would have great cauſe to thank me.</p>
            <p>But as to his Book more expreſly thus, In the beginning he ſtiffly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies all the Principles of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> (which I mentioned) ſave <hi>Alome,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99554:7"/>and diſputes againſt me with <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil Language,</hi> ſuch as the Schools know not, and all ingenuos men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor; and yet (would you think it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has done he yields them all to be there; <hi>viz. Iron P. 39.</hi> and <hi>P. 44.</hi> and <hi>45.</hi> So <hi>Vitriol, P. 359.</hi> And <hi>Nitre P. 360.</hi> and <hi>364.</hi> where he is put to a ſore pinch to <hi>fumble at Expreſſions,</hi> on purpoſe to blind ſome capacities from diſcovering his Contradictions. To ſay no more than truth, I never met with any Author ſo <hi>unſtable</hi> in his Writings, even <hi>to ſay and unſay,</hi> as this my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, which I ſhall point at as I paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>Then he goes on to tell what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes the Spaw cures, and what not, wherein he is altogether <hi>Mimical;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly confined to what I have ſaid in my Book, or what in Reaſon may follow therefrom; for otherwiſe I am
<pb facs="tcp:99554:8"/>aſſured he is a meer ſtranger to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as he that never ſaw it; to which yet I can adde ſome eminent Cures, that I have not already expreſſed.</p>
            <p>He next paſſes on to treat of the Cauſes of ſeveral Diſeaſes, which he refers to ſome Fault in his Five <hi>Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions (I wonder he did not make 50.)</hi> This Notion is purely <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts,</hi> though he curtails his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of which he has a peculiar Tract, called <hi>Sextuplex Digeſtio alimenti humani,</hi> P. <hi>166.</hi> But for want of the right underſtanding of Anatomy Sir <hi>S.</hi> groſly miſtakes, which our Modern Authors ſince the happy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Circulation of the Blood, and ſome Veſſels lately found out in the Contexture of the Parts, by ſome of our own ingenious Countreymen, have more intelligently propoſed.</p>
            <p>In his Diſcourſe about the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Hot Springs,</hi> he determines
<pb facs="tcp:99554:8"/>the heat to proceed from a Mine of <hi>Vive Calx;</hi> which Notion he grounds upon a Relation that I made in my Book of a moſt Ingenuous Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Noble Lord</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, near the City <hi>Bathe,</hi> though he has not ſo much ingenuity as to own it, To ſay what I find, he is reſolved to do me no right.</p>
            <p>Where he undervalues the <hi>Rational Method of Phyſick,</hi> and extols his own Medicines as more Noble and Succeſsful, I ſhall joyn iſſue with him in weighing his Arguments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his Medicines which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has deſcribed, together with ſome matters of Fact, as they relate to him. Here I would not be thought as if I were an Enemy to the <hi>Chymical Way,</hi> or thoſe that are Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof. I am ſerious I account it a ſingular <hi>Additament</hi> and <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the <hi>Noble Art of Phyſick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99554:9"/>and the moſt uſeful Part of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophy;</hi> and ſuch as the <hi>Old Princes</hi> in Phyſick would have rejoyced to have known. And I do ſincerely love and honour thoſe that imploy their Talents in a genuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of wholſom Medicines, out of the <hi>Minerals</hi> and <hi>Metals;</hi> and I have not been idle altogether in thoſe Operations my ſelf, having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had a Laboratory of my own, wherein a very <hi>Learned Gentleman</hi> of this Kingdom, and my ſelf did imploy ſome time and money; and of late I have not been wanting to make ſeveral <hi>Experiments</hi> out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of this Spaw, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſeveral places of my Book, though not with ſuch Noyſe and Cracks.</p>
            <p>Beſides in my Practice near 30 years (wherein on this ſudden I can ſcarce think on any Diſeaſe which has
<pb facs="tcp:99554:9"/>not been under my Cure) I have not been wanting to uſe them according as I ſaw cauſe: wherein what my ſucceſs has been, I chuſe rather to let my Countrey report; only this I may with modeſty affirm, it has been like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of my Faculty. And I muſt alſo declare that what ever my ſucceſs has been, I muſt rather aſcribe it to the Bleſsing of God upon a <hi>Rational Method,</hi> than Chymical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>But why any that addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that Study, ſhould go about to make Chymiſtry an Art of its own kind, or like a <hi>Viperous Brat</hi> to eat through the Bowels of its Dam, and ſo to cry down that wholſome Method, and thoſe Medicines, that in the hands of Artiſts, have in all Ages proved ſucceſsful for the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I ſee no reaſon in the world. And I am ſure there is no cauſe, why
<pb facs="tcp:99554:10"/>this Man ſhould ſo magnifie his own Preparations in compariſon of others, as I ſhall with ſatisfaction have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make out anon.</p>
            <p>Touching his Project for an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Character</hi> (which a man would wonder how he ſhould bring into this Diſcourſe, ſave that he would be a <hi>Sir Poſitive-At-all.)</hi> He has all his hints from a very <hi>Reverend Perſon</hi> of this Nation, who before his Book on that Subject came out, was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently free in diſcourſe concerning the thing, and had given out ſeveral Eſſays.</p>
            <p>As to his Diſcourſe about the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Principles of all Concretes,</hi> which he fetches from <hi>Helmont,</hi> quarrelling at the Three Ordinary Principles of the Chymiſts, to wit, <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the Five of others, he reſolves all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water, which certainly is a Mixt
<pb facs="tcp:99554:10"/>Body, and conſiſts of the Four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements. And (I pray) may not that again be eaſily reſolved into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo become an Argument to prove the Creation?</p>
            <p>In his Appendix concerning the <hi>Original of Springs</hi> He is moſt <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous,</hi> and ſhews himſelf to be a man that can bluſh at nothing; pretending to have anſwered all the Arguments in my Book, which I have urged for <hi>Rain and Snow Water</hi> to be the <hi>Original of Springs;</hi> when he leaps over no leſs than three or four whereon the ſtreſs of the Opinion does moſt lie, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touches upon ſomething that I brought in by way of Illuſtration, not of Proof. I am aſhamed that any man that pretends ſo highly, ſhould reſpect his Credit no more, but impoſe upon the Reader, who perhaps not ſeeing my Book, would
<pb facs="tcp:99554:11"/>be induced to give him Credit. (<hi>viz. Scarbrough Spaw Second Edition,</hi> from <hi>P. 97.</hi> to <hi>119.</hi>) Beſides that being pinched with an Argument of Demonſtration, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from <hi>Dr. Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography,</hi> he calls in Queſtion the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> of that <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Reverend Gentleman (P. 301.)</hi> In the mean time he eſtabliſhes his own Opinion upon a meer naked <hi>Suppoſition (P. 317.)</hi> which he ought neceſſarily to have proved, or elſe his Superſtruction will fall to the ground, for want of a Solid Foundation. Yet in that Diſcourſe all he has is from <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherus</hi> in his <hi>Mundus Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning his <hi>Ternary of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> which next to his oppoſing of me, is the grand Deſign of his Book; there is great cauſe to ſuſpect
<pb facs="tcp:99554:11"/>he will fall ſhort of his aim. Thoſe are his <hi>Scorbutick Pills</hi> for Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his <hi>Cordial Elixir,</hi> and his <hi>Diaphoretick.</hi> Can any Rational Man think that all <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> are ſo eaſily cured? I am afraid theſe Pills may at length prove like his <hi>Lunar Pills,</hi> which he mentions <hi>(P. 120.)</hi> ſometimes as highly extolled by him, and uſed as his <hi>Catholicon,</hi> which upon trial ſome poor men probably ſmarted for; for he declares them <hi>unſucceſsful,</hi> and adviſes againſt the further uſe of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being made up with <hi>Aqua fortial,</hi> and other <hi>Corroſive</hi> and <hi>Poyſonous</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> doubtleſs its a good Medicine being duly uſed. Now there are ſeveral wayes of preparing it mentioned by <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont, Crollius, Amynſicht,</hi> and others, all of them
<pb facs="tcp:99554:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>magnifying their own Preparations. But it is a Medicine very hot, whoſe Vehicle is the <hi>Tartariſed Spirit of Wine,</hi> and ſo not likely to ſute as a <hi>Cordial in all Diſeaſes;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there are ſome that uſe it, till they are even come into <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb</hi> among the <hi>Vulgar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching his <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> it is to be doubted, he makes it of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſive Oyl of <hi>Antimony</hi> mentioned <hi>(P. 180.)</hi> which he tells <hi>(P. 188.)</hi> is a more deſperate poyſon than <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury Sublimate</hi> it ſelf, which all men know will corrode Iron. I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we ſhall ſhortly ſee his Bills upon the Poſts of the City, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Quacks, proclaiming this Ternary, as ſometimes he did with his <hi>Amulet for the Plague,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſuſpect I have marred his Market.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99554:12"/>
            <p> And laſtly he concludes with an <hi>Epilogue,</hi> wherein he moſt gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recants all that he had ſaid in his <hi>Hydrologia,</hi> concerning the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Spaw.</hi> For whereas he denied <hi>Vitriol</hi> to be there, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me for aſſerting it, he confeſſes upon further trial, that there it is in its Body, to wit <hi>Terra Vitrioli (P. 359.)</hi> then he confeſſes <hi>Nitre (P. 360.)</hi> yea and <hi>(P. 364.)</hi> he yields it to be of all the Minerals the <hi>moſt predominant,</hi> even as I had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Book <hi>(P. 13.)</hi> And he is forced to come off with a <hi>woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> at the lower end of that <hi>(P. 364.) That he only meant that its not the Nitre of the Shops, which is vulgarly ſold.</hi> To ſay the truth, he was <hi>forced</hi> to make this <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as I ſhall make out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99554:13"/>
            <p> By this time I ſuppoſe the Candid and Judicious Reader diſcerns the folly of the young man, whoſe wrath and envy againſt me, have excited him to abuſe the World with an ill premeditated piece of work. <hi>Inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis eſt dicere non putaram.</hi> But what ſatisfaction have I now for the injuries he has offered me, in his cauſleſs endeavour to blaſt my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; I moſt willingly ſubmit all to the Ingenuity of the Judicious and Impartial Reader, being ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him when he ſhall make his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
            <p>And now I ſuppoſe I might very well ſpare my ſelf any further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but I am not ſo minded, let me beg thy patience a little <hi>(Gentle Reader)</hi> till I lay down the grounds of this mans quarrel againſt me, and enlarge <hi>my Epiſtle</hi> with a few Notes upon <hi>his,</hi> and then Ile proceed to his Book.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99554:13"/>
            <p> About four or five years ago at the moſt, <hi>Sir Simpſon</hi> began to ſet up for himſelf in the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and about the ſame time <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> alſo, whom he glances at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his Book. Theſe had a Project to overturn the <hi>Rational Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſick</hi> in this City and County of <hi>York,</hi> and reduce all to the <hi>Chymical Way.</hi> In order to which, in all Companies, and more eſpecially at the <hi>Coffee-Houſes,</hi> they were conſtantly declaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Medicines of the Shops, which are prepared according to the <hi>Diſpenſatory eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land;</hi> and magnifying their own Medicines, by which they pretended to be able <hi>to do wonders.</hi> (How far this took with ſome of our Faculty, I ſhall not now mention.) But there were not wanting others of my Learned Brethren, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:99554:14"/>with my ſelf, did judge it our duty <hi>Rem populi tractare,</hi> and to ſtand up in defence both of the lives of our Friends, and the <hi>Rational Method,</hi> being yet no Enemies to the <hi>Chymical Way,</hi> and ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as therein we knew to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſafe.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially I my ſelf did more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and publickly appear among the <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen,</hi> that meet at the Coffee-Houſes to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their deſign, and did ſpeed accordingly; on which account they give out, that I am a <hi>Diſcourager of Ingenuity,</hi> which yet thoſe that kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w me will <hi>teſtifie to be falſe.</hi> They to requite me, call in further Aſsiſtance, as I ſhall by and by make out; and combined to fall upon me in reference to my <hi>Book of the Spaw;</hi> where though they wanted juſt matter of <hi>Exception,</hi> as I ſhall (no doubt)
<pb facs="tcp:99554:14"/>clearly evince, yet they deſigned like <hi>Hannibal</hi> upon the <hi>Alps, aut inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire viam, aut facere;</hi> ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non jerking at my words, and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſenſe, pretending to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Water both in its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Vertues; whereas in truth they could, nor have ſaid any more, than I had done in more compendious and intelligible words. And to make the Book more taking among the Vulgar, they have stufft it with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments fetcht from all Modern Writers, that have treated of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy</hi> (very few of them being their own) which they have confuſedly drawn into this Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago, as <hi>Cacus</hi> did <hi>Hercules</hi> his Oxen inverſed or reverſed, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the Reader, and on purpoſe to palliate their Theft. In the mean time they were all of them bolting out ſeveral Expreſsions againſt me
<pb facs="tcp:99554:15"/>and my Book this <hi>year and an half,</hi> which now are come to light, through my ſides aiming to wound the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Practice of Phyſick, which even now they think they have effected, in this City; or at leaſt they were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hope they had done it.</p>
            <p>Another difference there happened betwixt <hi>Sir Simpſon</hi> and my ſelf. One <hi>Robert Beford</hi> a very ingenious <hi>Lock-Smith</hi> about <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> years ago, was my Patient in a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> which I had managed about <hi>10</hi> dayes, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great hopes of a Cure: In which Diſeaſe (I thank God) I have often performed many good Cures. On the ſudden he told me, he would take no more Phyſick, ſaying, he was weak, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick would kill him; I told him he muſt aſſuredly die of his Diſeaſe, if there he left off. At length I underſtood that <hi>Sir Simpſon</hi> was called to him <hi>(by a good wife)</hi> who had put this
<pb facs="tcp:99554:15"/>whimſie in his head, and promiſed a Cure within a <hi>Fortnight,</hi> by his <hi>Chymical Medicines,</hi> which he ſaid were <hi>not Phyſick.</hi> But the Patient grew every day worſe, I having a reſpect for ſuch an ingenious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſent to <hi>Mr. Simpſon</hi> (whom I had not ſeen before) deſiring him to meet me at the Apothecaries Shop, and demanded wherefore he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged my Medicines, having not ſeen my Bills, which were extant in the Apothecaries Shop. He ſaid he did not diſparage my Medicines but my Method, to wit, the <hi>Galenical Way,</hi> in which it was not poſsible to cure a <hi>Dropſie.</hi> I told him I had cured many a <hi>Dropſie</hi> in that <hi>Method,</hi> before he knew what was Latine for the Word. And withal I told him, that if ever he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take any Degree in Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:99554:16"/>expected he ſhould viſit me, and then he ſhould give an account of that <hi>unjuſt Calumniation.</hi> I alſo told him that the man would aſſuredly die, which came to paſs within <hi>3</hi> weeks after his firſt Call; complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a moſt <hi>horrible heat and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion</hi> in his Belly, from the <hi>heat of his Medicines</hi> (as the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did conceive) eſpecially from <hi>ſome Pills,</hi> that he gave him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the time that he had left me.</p>
            <div type="reflections">
               <head>Some Reflections on <hi>Sir Simpſon</hi>'s Epiſtle.</head>
               <p>The Deſign of this Author as he expreſſes in this Epiſtle, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Principles of <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> whether they be ſuch as I have deſcribed them in my Book, which if it had been really for the
<pb facs="tcp:99554:16"/>diſcovery of Truth, he would have modeſtly carried on his Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Perſonal Reflexions,</hi> which are exceedingly ill becoming any man, eſpecially one ſo young, who like a <hi>Cockerell</hi> but <hi>newly hatched</hi> out of his Shell, begins to <hi>crow fiercely.</hi> It is not <hi>Victory</hi> that I value, but <hi>Truth</hi> that I ſerve, which doth prompt me to ſtop his Carier.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore take what liberty he <hi>has given me,</hi> to examine his Book, eſpecially in thoſe things that relate to my ſelf, and the common Cauſe of Phyſick in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as it is by him ſtated betwixt the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> and the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> not troubling my ſelf with his other impertinent digreſsions (further than what I have already glaunced at) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſtudy brevity, and would neither trifle away my own time, nor the kind Readers with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:99554:17"/>on the by. What I ſee amiſs in him, I ſhall endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in my ſelf, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe plain and intelligible Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, being deſirous to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all that know but their own Mother Tongue. My Method ſhall be that of his, for I'l trace him in his ſteps.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>If any Writings of his ſhall be found as equally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and fenceleſs as mine are, he will be content with the ſame meaſure he has meted to me.</hi> To which I reply, my Book was ſent abroad in a plain and <hi>modeſt Dreſs,</hi> according to the commendable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the Times for things of that Nature; <hi>without gawdry,</hi> being guarded with <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Verity,</hi> which I expected would have been its <hi>ſufficient ſecurity.</hi> If its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in its paſſage was like that of
<pb facs="tcp:99554:17"/>the <hi>Samaritane</hi> to heal and clothe it, though perhaps ſome body elſe may pay the <hi>Reckoning</hi> in the Concluſion. As for his Writings, they appear (methink) like the Crow that <hi>Horace</hi> tells of in his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> that was gawdily attired with the Feathers of other Birds, which became a <hi>Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stock,</hi> when every Bird came for its own. <hi>Movit Cornicula riſum, Furtivis nudata coloribus.</hi> Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable I may let him ſee he is at my mercy, and not ſo well fenced as he imagines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He brags much of the Chymical Way gaining ground in the World, and that at length it will worm out the Galenical Method.</hi> I am glad it is a <hi>Method;</hi> I ſuſpect he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo call the Chymical Practice. Nothing does better conduce to dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> This Galenical Method has ſtood theſe
<pb facs="tcp:99554:18"/>
                  <hi>1500</hi> years, ever ſince the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher;</hi> whom <hi>Galen</hi> had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſerve as his Phyſician; and I ſee no Reaſon why it may not hold out <hi>1500</hi> years more; ſince it does not grow to decay through Age, but take <hi>deeper Root.</hi> Let no man ſtartle at this his <hi>Prognoſtick,</hi> ſince it is not founded upon ſolid Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I am certain it cannot be from any hints he can take from his own <hi>growth of Practice</hi> or <hi>Succeſs.</hi> His project is now like to be more fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to the former, by being more known; and for the latter I appeal to the Inhabitants of this City of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to his own Chymical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, he ſays, there are not many that he values, and quarrels at ſuch of them, as extoll their petit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for Panacea's.</hi> The truth
<pb facs="tcp:99554:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>is he would have all men modeſt but himſelf. He will not allow <hi>Amyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, Crollius, Beguinus,</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius</hi> to cry up their Receits, for fear his Market be marred when he comes by and by to magnifie his <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> He abhors that fault in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of which himſelf has more guilt. May not we have more reaſon to ſuſpect his <hi>Ternary</hi> he magnifies ſo much, for the Cure of <hi>all Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> than he has thoſe Authors, whoſe eminent learning and labours made out in their Writings, has gained them a good Reputation in the World; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we come to diſcern by and by the property of the matter out of which they are made. To ſay the truth, he likes none of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts well, but <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and <hi>Zwelfer,</hi> and <hi>Himſelt,</hi> whom he accounts moſt able to judge of them all. He commends <hi>Helmont
<pb facs="tcp:99554:19"/>for pulling down the Galenical Theory,</hi> and ſays, <hi>he rears up a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> This is but in his judgement which is not very great.</p>

            <p>I Shall begin with a paſſage out of this Book of Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi>'s in his own words (<hi>Page</hi> 214.) <hi>Few there are</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who buſie themſelves to write, but they have ſome Novelty either in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Theory, or Practice, to preſent the World with; yet they commonly do ſo wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and ſpin it out at length, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtantial, and often impertinent Notions, that they fill up a Volume, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99554:22"/>that that they might have compriſed in half a dozen Pages: All the reſt are meer Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and Appendices, which being tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, few men will cumber their heads withal; and therefore in effect they ſignifie nothing.</hi> Certainly nothing can be ſaid in <hi>Few</hi> ſo appoſite, to diſcover the deſign of this mans writing this Book, and his manner of doing it. Here we have a Hodg-potch of Novelty in the <hi>Theory and Practice</hi> of Phyſick, wire-drawn and ſpun out at length, with a company of impertinent Notions, that ſignifie <hi>nothing</hi> but to fill up the Volume and raiſe a <hi>great dust.</hi> The reſt are meer <hi>Flouriſhes</hi> and ſuch a ſort of <hi>Appendices</hi> and <hi>Fragments,</hi> as I never read the like; which indeed do ſignifie nothing, but to ſpend pretious time that might be far better imployed. I ſhall here apply that paſſage of <hi>Natales Comes,</hi> which he has concerning <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> his introducing a new Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notion, <hi>viz.

                  </gap> Controverſiae,</hi> the ſtate of his quarrel turns upon this hinge. My words are theſe, <hi>I take it to be the Iron Mineral with a Touch of the Vitriol; Or if you pleaſe</hi> Ferrum Vitriolatum, <hi>or</hi> Vitriolum Ferrugineum.</p>
            <p>Here I deſire the Reader to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he does frequently leave out my words, or matter, wherein the main ſcope of my buſineſs conſiſts; on purpoſe to make himſelf Elbow-room to abuſe me. Although I intend not hereby, as if I meant this Vitriol in the <hi>Spaw</hi> to be made out of Iron; for what have we to do with <hi>factitious</hi> Vitriol? But this is a <hi>natural</hi> Vitriol generated in the Veins of the Earth, through which the Spring runs, which has by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>idity or Eſurine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99554:24"/>Salt, actuated the Waters; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is enabled to corrode a Vein of Iron, which is there alſo; and likewiſe ſome other Minerals, of which more anon. Now this Water thus impregnated with a <hi>Vitrioline Odour or Vapour,</hi> ſince it has no Emetick or Vomiting Quality joyned with it, I account it to be of the Nature of that which is made out of <hi>Iron</hi> (not of <hi>Copper</hi>) and therefore I called it <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolum Ferrugineum.</hi> But I do affirm, that common Spring-Water it ſelf, is a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> proper enough to take in any of the Minerals we are treating of, and will not fail to do it if they lie in its way; although if it meet with any Acid Salt, as this is of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> it will do it the more freely. And this a grees with that which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf has ſaid, provided the Minerals or Metals be not come to Maturity (<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Natur. Aquis, cap. de Aq. Gustabilibus.</hi>) Yea and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himſelf confeſſes it (<hi>P.</hi> 59.) Number 10, 11, and 12. Dr. <hi>Jordane</hi> aſſerts the ſame concerning Simple Waters, that by reaſon of their tenuity they may imbibe either Spirit, or Juice, or Tinctures, from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99554:24"/>Metals before their Conſolidation (<hi>Nat. Baths cap.</hi> 14,) Yea and <hi>Kircherus,</hi> who in his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus</hi> treats at large of this Subject, accounts Simple Spring Water a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> fit enough to imbibe a Mineral or Metal; for he mentions not any <hi>Primum Ens</hi> or other Mineral Acidity.</p>
            <p>I ſay by its Eſurine Salt it more freely corrodes the <hi>Iron,</hi> and carries it <hi>in gremio</hi> out with it; which is the more eaſily done, becauſe the Iron is not here a perfect So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Metal, but <hi>in ſolutis principiis,</hi> and in ſome tendency to it; being yet of the ſame nature with Iron: And this Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol is not ſo properly ſaid to be made by an Eſurine Salt, as to have an Eſurine Salt or Spirit in it ſelf. And this does agree with the general Suffrage of all Learned Writers, as well <hi>Chymiſts</hi> as others; as <hi>Libavius in his Syntag. Geber, Caeſalpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jordan;</hi> and not only Vitriol, but Nitre alſo, they ſay diſſolved in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will enable it to corrode Metals; and to this alſo conſents <hi>Fallopius</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>de Thermal Aq.</hi>)</p>

            <p> This being premiſed, that Suppoſition of Vitriol of Copper to be diſſolved in the Water, is not to be ſuppoſed, and what follows thereon is altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>However (<hi>B.</hi> 3.) he ſays, <hi>This being granted in</hi> FAVOUR <hi>of his Mineral Ingredients or Principles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iron will be found impertinent and inſignificant as to the body of it.</hi> Sir, Keep your <hi>Favours</hi> for others.</p>
            <q>Timeo Danaos etiam dona ferentes.</q>
            <p>I look for none of your <hi>Favours,</hi> nor need them, I ſuſpect your very mercies are cruel; what I would have in this Diſpute, I ſhall by and by force you to grant me, and have no cauſe to return you any thanks. But whereas he ſays <hi>Iron is not here in its body.</hi> What would Sir <hi>S.</hi> have? A Horſeſhooe Naile? It is not here indeed to be found, nor will 100 Gallons of the Water afford ſo much Iron as to make one. But here is a <hi>palpable Powder,</hi> which when a little Gall is put into the Water, by which it turns
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99554:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>black (which Colour it takes from the Vitriol) there will ſettle after ſome hours upon the agitation of the Veſſel, a <hi>black Powder</hi> near a Dram in a Gallon, which by powring the Water gently from it <hi>per inclinationem,</hi> will be found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; which if you dry in the Sun, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fire, has a Stiptick or drying taſte like <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inwardly in any form whatſoever, doth tinge the Excrements with a <hi>blackiſh Colour,</hi> as all our preparations out of <hi>Iron</hi> do. Beſides if this Water be carried abroad to <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Hull,</hi> which is 30 mile off, there will be found in the Veſſel a <hi>yellowiſh Sediment,</hi> according to the quantity of Water, which being dried, has the ſame taſte with <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> or prepared Steel, and ſurpaſſing it in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy; and this ſeparation or precipitation of this Metalline Subſtance, is furthered by Agitation in the Carriage; eſpecially if in Oaken Veſſels: although I have alſo obſerved the ſame in Glaſſe Bottles, which were carried abroad.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> objects (as he thinks) ſtrongly againſt theſe two Minerals <hi>Iron</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99554:26"/>and <hi>Vitriol</hi> to be there imbibed, becauſe ſays he (<hi>P.</hi> 3.) <hi>The Eſurine Salt which goes to the diſſolving of Vitriol, of what ſort ſoever (and he ſuppoſes Copper) is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by terminated in its action; and though the Water of the Spring ſo impregnated, ſhould afterwards meet with a Vein of</hi> Iron, <hi>yet it can take nothing thence, being already ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and having loſt its ſting.</hi>

                  <hi>Of</hi> Ens Primum.</note>To this I reply, The Eſurine Salt is that which (<hi>P.</hi> 5.) he calls <hi>Ens Primum,</hi> out of <hi>Helmont,</hi> which he ſays gives the Medicinal Vertue to Vitriol. I do not at all like the uſe of that Name <hi>Ens Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi> in this ſenſe, which the Old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, that wanted better light, gave to ſome thing of a higher Nature, even to <hi>God himſelf;</hi> from whom doubtleſs both <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and all Minerals, Metals, and Vegetables, have received whatever Medicinal Vertue they have in them; for it is he that created Medicine out of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing to impregnate this Water, where we can without any <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> at all, directly point at the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99554:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>Water it ſelf as a proper <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> as I have made out already; and if that will not ſerve, then here is the Eſurine Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>ſufficient Efficacy,</hi> in the Judgement of Reaſon, to do the work we expect, and indeed find to be done; and this agrees alſo with what <hi>Helmont</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays in his fourth Paradox; where he ſays, <hi>That which is volatile,</hi> viz. <hi>a Spirit whether is be Concrete or Liquid, may corrode other Mineral Bodies.</hi> Beſides the Novelty of the Notion of his <hi>Primum Ens</hi> gives ground of ſuſpition, the whole Current of Learned Authors that have written of Medicinal Waters, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuch thing, whether <hi>Chymiſts or others:</hi> All accounting the Eſurine Spirit or Juyce of Vitriol, enough to impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a Water with an Acidity, that ſhall make it to corrode other Minerals or Metals by which it paſſes.

            <p> Again (I anſwer) it is both repugnant to Reaſon and Experience, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Learned Writers, who have treated of theſe Matters.

            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99554:27"/>
            <p> But further I reply, If this be true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,<note place="margin">A Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> as his confidence does ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; for he ſays (<hi>P.</hi> 4.) <hi>If one of the Principles be made by this Eſurine Acidity. Nature is not at leaſure to make another; which were ſuch an Indulgence as ſhe never granted her ſelf.</hi> How does this agree with that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himſelf ſays (<hi>P.</hi> 45.) in the beginning of the Second Section? <hi>viz. Thus far I aſſented,</hi> viz. <hi>That an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Salt from a Mineral Acidity had diſſolved a ſleight touch of the</hi> Mineral <hi>of</hi> Iron. <hi>and both diſſolved in the Current Spring of Water, makes up the</hi> Spaw. Are not here two Minerals made, <hi>viz. Iron</hi> and <hi>Alome,</hi> by his own Confeſſion? The like Confeſſion he makes (<hi>P.</hi> 61. <hi>N.</hi> 16.) Nay further, Ile ſee if I cannot find two more. Look (<hi>P.</hi> 359.) and there he ſays, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a farther Trial of the</hi> Spaw <hi>Water, he found a Body of Vitriol, which he calls</hi> Terra Vitrioli. Then turn but over leaf to (<hi>P.</hi> 360) <hi>and he tells you he found Nitre:</hi> And ſo again (<hi>P.</hi> 361.)</p>
            <p>How now (Mr. <hi>S.</hi>) how will theſe things hang together, can all your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy reconcile this Contradiction? What
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99554:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>now will become of your Inference you deduce from the former Aſſertion in (<hi>P.</hi> 4.) viz. <hi>So then we find a flaw in the main Timber of his Building; an Inconſiſtency of two of his Chief Principles of the</hi> Spaw, Iron <hi>and</hi> Vitriol. Certainly an Inference drawn from both ends of a Contradiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sinvalid.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not thus paſs it over. He has told us here (<hi>Pag.</hi> 3.) <hi>That the</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Ens <hi>or Eſurine Salt having diſſolved one Mineral, is thereby terminated, ſo as if it ſhould meet with another, it can take nothing thence.</hi> Now let us caſt our Eye upon (<hi>P.</hi> 59.) where Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath quite forgotten what he ſaid here; for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Sulphurious Eſurine Salt (he ſays) <hi>It becomes determined and ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the difference of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Glebes it meets with, into this or that Foſſible Salt or Mineral Mixture;</hi> which he illuſtrates by an Inſtance which he has <hi>verbatim</hi> from <hi>Sendivogius,</hi> Lumen Chym. Trac. 2. <hi>As ſuppoſe ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Salts placed at a diſtance one from another upon a large Marble, and common Simple Water is conveyed to each of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99554:28"/>them, this Water although the ſame to all, yet as it comes to every of them, is different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tinged and taſted, according to the Colour and Taſte of thoſe parcels it meets with. So</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this Eſurine Sulphureous Spirit, meeting With variety of Mineral Earths, though the ſame in it ſelf to every one, yet becomes altered and tinctured according to the different property of the Mineral Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this Contradiction he has ☜ other Inferences which he mentions, not worthy here to be recited.— Here is an able Philoſopher indeed, that can aſſert Contradictions, and draw <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> But I ſhall leave this to the Readers Contemplation, becauſe I ſtudy to be ſhort, and ſhall only ſay at preſent, I never found any man ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf; only he aimed (<hi>P.</hi> 3.) to perſwade the unwary Readers, that it was impoſſible that <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> could be both in this Water, as I had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>I could now bring in the Teſtimony of <hi>Learned Writers,</hi> who tell of ſeveral ſorts of Springs in <hi>Europe,</hi> that have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99554:29"/>two or three ſorts of Minerals. As at St. <hi>Lucas</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> there is one that has imbibed <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Alome.</hi> Another in <hi>Germany</hi> which is impregnated with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome</hi> and <hi>Nitre;</hi> ſo as <hi>Erneſtus a Chymiſt</hi> can hardly determine which of the two is more predominant. So in <hi>Sweden</hi> one that has both <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Copper.</hi> And thus alſo the ordinary Spaws in <hi>Germany</hi> have imbibed <hi>Vitriol, Iron,</hi> and <hi>Ochre,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Heers</hi> relates in his <hi>Spadacrene.</hi> And <hi>Fallopius</hi> mentions ſeveral ſuch as have partaked of ſeveral Minerals, in his Book <hi>De Therm.

And this was my care in the compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that Book (wherein notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this return, I repent <hi>NOT ONE</hi> Sentence) to hold cloſe to the Authority of the moſt Learned or Right Reaſon, in all things ſubmitting to the more Wiſe and Learned. And in Truth I profeſs, I did not at that time conſult theſe Chymical Authors, I have now an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to revolve in this Diſpute about theſe Minerals; whom yet I find concur with me in all I have ſaid concerning them.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Antagoniſt, who (<hi>P.</hi> 6, and 7.) is forced to confeſs, <hi>That a Mineral or Metal, while young and in</hi> ſolutis principiis, <hi>or in</hi> fieri, <hi>and in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Juice, may be imbibed by a Current of Water, eſpecially if it has been acuated by an Eſurine Salt;</hi> which is the ſame I have ſaid in my Book, and have now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain proved concerning this Spring.</p>
            <p>Yet (<hi>P.</hi> 10.) where he has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to what I ſay concerning the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of Vitriol,</hi> and the Acidity which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99554:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>from thence the Water has imbibed (he ſays) <hi>he cannot paſs the Notion over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſmile;</hi> I am glad <hi>W. S.</hi> is ſo merry, I ſuſpect by and by he'l be found to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. But in truth, when he comes in that Page to be <hi>ſerious,</hi> he appears a <hi>Fool in earneſt,</hi> while he will have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Galls to be that which gives the Inky ſmell to the Water, when indeed the Water yeelds that ſmell, while 'tis clear and new-drawn out of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.<note place="margin">A ſcrious Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ink.</note> And ſeeing Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> tells us he is <hi>ſerious,</hi> let us a little more obſerve what he ſays, for probably we may find ſomewhat worth hearing. Here he gives us a gallant <hi>Definition of Ink</hi> in theſe words: viz. <hi>It is a ſolution of</hi> Vitriol <hi>precipitated, or made opacous by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Galls, whoſe ſtipticity makes the</hi> DIAPHANEOUS <hi>Texture of the Particles in the Vitrioline ſolution deſert their former posture, and muster in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed</hi> OPACOUS <hi>manner, filling thoſe interſtices with ſolid Particles, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were kept tranſparent, by the fluid parts of the Water, equally contempered.</hi> Is not here good ſport? This brings to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99554:38"/>my mind the Definition of a <hi>Window,</hi> which another Son of <hi>Rhombus</hi> gave forth in a Pulpit, on occaſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let down out of the <hi>Window</hi> in a Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. A <hi>Window,</hi> which he ſtiled a <hi>Fene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,</hi> is a <hi>Diaphanous</hi> part of an <hi>Edifice, erected by the manual operation of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect, for the Introduction of Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through an Opake Body into the Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Convex Organ of the Intellestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Animal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which next diſguſts him, is, <hi>That I diſcourſe of</hi> Vitriol <hi>and</hi> Iron <hi>apart, and have not included one of them in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he would have lookt upon as a point of Philoſophy in good earneſt.</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 10.) It had not been ſo in earneſt; nor do I at all believe him if I had done ſo, neither I think will any rational man that reads him, ſince 'tis apparent he was reſolved to quarrel right or wrong. I pray <hi>Sir Simpſon</hi> are <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> all one? I think they do as really differ as your <hi>Knife</hi> and your <hi>Ink:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> not the ſame thing.</note> I ſpeak not of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious Vitriol,</hi> but <hi>Natural,</hi> which is in <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> or which you ſaw break out of the Cliffe near the Well,

His words are, <hi>Summum ergo ſtudium eſſe debet, ut Natura Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, Metallorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>exacte teneatur, ſic enim fiet ut Aquarum ex illis genita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, conditio ac vis probe cognita ſit.</hi> Now if I had deſcribed the Vertues of the Water from <hi>Iron only,</hi> or from <hi>Vitriol alone,</hi> ſince that <hi>Vitriol</hi> which we have here, is not that which is made out of <hi>Iron,</hi> but produced by Nature it ſelf; diſcovering it ſelf both in the Water to the Taſt and Smell, and in the Cliffe to the Eye, being a <hi>Mineral of its own kind,</hi> and <hi>Iron a Metal,</hi> I had not done it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon.</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. P.</hi> 194.) treating of ſeveral prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Iron, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>with Salt,</hi> a ſecond <hi>with Alome,</hi> and a third <hi>with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> lays down his <hi>Receit, viz.

But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he muſt draw its Vertues from its compoſition with Vitriol, having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Vitriol, and ſomething from the Iron; or elſe he might as well never have joyned them.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Scroderus</hi> (in his <hi>Pharmac. Med. Chym. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>de ferro</hi> having laid down ſeveral preparations of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal of <hi>Mars,</hi> with Spirit of Salt and Sulphur; after the ſame manner (ſays he) <hi>Fiunt &amp; Cryſtalli Martis cum Spiritu Vitrioli, ſic habes Magiſterium Chalybis Vitriolatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Sennertus (cap. de Tinctur.) in the Extraction of the Tincture of Iron joyns Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, p.</hi> 1394.)</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Mattaeus Martinus de Scorbuto,</hi> puts them both together into one <hi>Recipe.</hi> (<hi>Intent.</hi> 3) And ſo <hi>Riverius</hi> (in his <hi>Praxis Med. (cap. de Fluxu Hepatico)</hi> joyns them together. And again <hi>(cap. de
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99554:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hepat. obstructione.) Sed prae caeteris om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Medicamentis, ad delendas obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones inveteratas maxime conferunt remedia ex tartaro, vitriolo, &amp; chalybe conflata.</hi> Then he goes on to tell of ſeveral prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made out of each of them, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: and further adds, <hi>Vitriolo autem Efficaciam oſtendunt Aquae naturales acidae &amp; vitriolatae, quarum uſus frequentiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; utiliſſimus eſt, in omnibus morbis ab obſtructionibus Oriundis.</hi> That is to ſay, The Efficacy of Vitriol is beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Natural Vitrioline Waters, whoſe uſe is moſt frequent, and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in all Diſeaſes that ariſe from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
            <p>Indeed nothing is more ordinary than to find our beſt Authors joyning Vitriol and Iron together, which certainly upon Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Principle, they ſhould not do, if they be both one thing. From all which 'tis to be inferred, that they do differ in kind; and ſince I find them both here, I ought in all reaſon to treat of them accordingly. Had I mentioned Iron alone, I had done little; for what would it have been better than a meet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99554:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Chalybeath</hi> Water, which might have been of ſome vertue indeed to open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, but not ſo penetrative; like a Raſor, good Metal, but had wanted an edge, beſides that it had not been full to the point. And if I had mentioned Vitriol alone, it had been like an edge indeed, but without the Metal wherein it was ſet.</p>
            <p>But what have I done herein more than others that treat of ſuch like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Dr. <hi>Heers</hi> ſays (in his <hi>Spadacrene P.</hi> 34.) That the German Spaws conſiſt of <hi>Iron, Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Ochre,</hi> thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> diſtinct as I have done. So <hi>Frambeſarius</hi> and <hi>Ryetius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But he accounts, <hi>This Vitriol to be ſo near of Kin to Iron, as that it is produced out of it.</hi> I reply, that hitherto he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them both, and therefore his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is impertinent, while I am proving them both. Beſides if this were ſo, then they would differ as <hi>Materia</hi> and <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatum,</hi> which ſure are not the ſame, but may be diſcourſed of ſeverally; or elſe the <hi>whole Current of Philoſophers</hi> are in a great Error, and muſt learn of <hi>Sir Simpſon.</hi>

            <p> That this Spring is of an Azure or Sky. Colour it is plain to the Eye; from whence has it taken it, but from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed Minerals, among which I ſay (I think) it is the <hi>Vitriol, Iron,</hi> and <hi>Alome;</hi> and my reaſon for it is, Becauſe theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infuſed, do contribute ſuch a Colour to Water (but eſpecially I judge it to be from the <hi>Vitriol.</hi>) But this man is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere he will not allow me to ſay what I think, but cries out on't as <hi>Precarious Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>want of Chymical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</hi> In the former I aſſure him, I own nothing but what is grounded in ſound Reaſon or Sence, nor do I in the particulars we are treating of: And as for the latter, I know as much as I need, and perhaps he will think by and by I know too much in knowing him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have other neceſſary imployment for my time, ſo as I cannot have leiſure to lay it out in making Mechanical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I ſhall leave that to others or him, who has little elſe to do.</p>
            <p>But yet that Mr <hi>S.</hi> may know that this is not precarious, but others are of the ſame mind, I refer him to <hi>Kircher</hi>

               <note place="margin">How to diſcern <hi>Vitriol</hi> in the Spring.</note>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> queries ſtill (<hi>P.</hi> 11.) <hi>How came the Doctor to know that</hi> Vitriol <hi>and</hi> Iron <hi>were ingredients, ſeeing the Badges of diſtinction claſh?</hi> &amp;c. To this I think I have ſaid enough already to ſatisfie any intelligent man, and yet further thus briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to <hi>Vitriol,</hi> I knew this to be there from the Eminent Acidity of the Water; and though I did not learn this out of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> yet I find him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with me in judging by this Token: (<hi>De Natur. Baln. Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9.) <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae nonnullae ſunt quae acetoſitatem &amp; dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedinem babent. Hae ſi ex nativa conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione tales ſunt, ex vitriolo oriuntur. Id enim ſi ex prima ſua materia reſolvitur, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetoſas aquas profert.</hi> To wit, There are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99554:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſome ſort of Baths or Waters that have an Acidity and Sweetneſs in them (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he means a pleaſant Acidity) theſe if from their Natural Conſtitution they are ſo, do ariſe from <hi>Vitriol;</hi> for if it happen to be reſolved: from its firſt mater in Waters, it makes them to become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Vitrioli virtutes illis aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandae ſunt,</hi> and therefore, ſays he, the properties of Vitriol are to be aſcribed to the Waters. (<hi>P.</hi> 189.)</p>
            <p>So <hi>Fallopius</hi> counts the Acidity to be a ſufficient token of the imbibition of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> (<hi>De Therm. Aq. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 217.) who treating of the <hi>Spaw</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that at <hi>Rome</hi> (concerning which I have met with ſeveral Gentlemen ſpeaking, That they are not ſo Acid as this at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough.</hi>) He ſays, <hi>Arbitror eas eſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas, quia habeant in ſe Chalcanthum puriſſimum,</hi> therefore I think them Acid, becauſe they have pure Vitriol in them.</p>
            <p>Another token of Vitriol is that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porrhaea Mineralis</hi> or Vitrioline <hi>Vapor,</hi> which any one of an indifferent ſmell may obſerve, which is ſomewhat like that of <hi>Ink,</hi> though more pure.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99554:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> A third Argument is that <hi>deep Tincture</hi> that the Water takes from Gall, more than any other I have ſeen or read of, which cannot come from the Alome (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi>'s perſwaſion, as I ſhall evince in its due place) nor any other of the Minerals.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, There is in this Cliffe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Six ſcore Paces of the Spring a <hi>Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Salt,</hi> which ſweats out of the Cliffe, of Dark Yellow Colour, very ſharp to the Taſte, even far beyond <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Alome;</hi> which affords good ground of probability that it is in the Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Iron <hi>in</hi> Scarbr. Spaw.</note>Touching <hi>Iron,</hi> it is (me think) plain that here it is in its <hi>Body,</hi> which is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to the bottom of the Veſſel, after it has ſtood ſome hours tinctured with Gall, there being in every Gallon near a Dram, when the Water is evaporated; which being calcined yields a <hi>ſcoria</hi> like Iron, and of Reddiſh Colour, as I ſhall have occaſion to make out by and by. Beſides that there is a Body of the like Nature and Vertue, that falls to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſels; wherein this Water is carried abroad into the Countrey; the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99554:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>like to which falls to the bottom of the Veſſel, wherein the Water is ſet upon the Fire for Evaporation, upon the firſt approach of the hear.</p>
            <p>Again, The Blackiſh Colour, which is imparted to the Excrements of thoſe that drink of theſe Waters, denotes Iron, it being peculiar to all the preparations of Iron, which we have occaſions to uſe.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, The Cliffe out of which this Spring flows, is plainly <hi>Iron,</hi> which though at the firſt when it falls it be like ordinary Earth, yet at length by the weather it becomes <hi>hard as Iron</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and is fuſible in the Fire. To all theſe I might adde, the ſingular Vertues which are evident in the Water for <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriack Diſeaſes,</hi> the Stone, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Tone of the Stomach, both in point of Appetite and Digeſtion, do ſufficiently make out the preſence of them both.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Exceptions made by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> againſt the firſt way I mentioned, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Water might imbibe the <hi>Vapors</hi> of Minerals. The ſecond is, when ſome of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99554:44"/>their Juice is diſſolved in the Water, and that is while the Minerals are young, or in <hi>ſolutis principiis.</hi> This he paſſes over. Is it not kindneſs I can pleaſe him in any thing?<note place="margin">Of the Corroſion of the Subſtance of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</note> But he quarrels at my third way, and that is by corroſion of the ſubſtances of the Minerals mentioned by <hi>Galen</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Simpl. Med. fac. cap ult.</hi>) and this I ſaid is done by the help of the Concrete Juices, which extract and corrode Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubſtances. <hi>Here we find a Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way</hi> (ſays <hi>W. S.</hi>) <hi>of Selution, it is out of their road to diſcourſe of theſe Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Solutions, for want of Chymical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, which they are not at leaſure to take notice of.</hi> Ay! this is the Choak-Pear, the very Name of <hi>Galen</hi> is a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to <hi>W. S.</hi> I find him ever running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, where I had occaſion to name him. This is that which frets him, that the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> meddle with theſe Notions; and I confeſs I am not at very great lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure now to trouble myſelf with them, ſave that I am willing to ſtep out of my Road to curb the <hi>Cracks</hi> of a <hi>Thraſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any Contradiction in what I ſay in this Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99554:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>Concrete Juices corrode, and extract Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Metallick Subſtances. For the Concrete Juice of Vitriol which is of a Corroſive property, being imbibed in a Spring Water, will corrode other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals or Metals; (ſo ſays <hi>Helmont</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the place before cited) that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through, as <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Alome,</hi> whoſe Bodies are firmer, eſpecially before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation, which is the caſe of <hi>Iron</hi> here, as now I made out, and alſo of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome:</hi> for the Solvent and Agent is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, the Soluble and Patient is Iron.

Quia non ſunt adeo dura &amp; ſolida,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99554:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>ut in hac terrae ſuperficie; viz.</hi> becauſe they are not ſo hard and ſolid within the Earth, as they are upon the Superficies. And thus alſo ſay <hi>Galen, Vitruvius,</hi> and <hi>Livius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In (<hi>P.</hi> 13.) he repeats what he ſaid before of his Eſurine Salt, or <hi>Ens Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 3.) and how that it cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe any more Minerals than one, which I have there with good reaſon exploded, and ſufficiently confuted. And theſe will appear much more frivolous, when I ſhall by and by diſcover him confeſſing, that <hi>This very Water at Scarbrough</hi> has imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>four</hi> Minerals or Metals, <hi>viz. Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol, Iron, Alome,</hi> and <hi>Nitre.</hi>

            <p>But he frets at the Example I mention concerning <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> which corrodes the ſubſtance of a Metal put into it, and converts it to its own nature; whereby it is become all liquid, the ſolid Metal being become fluid as its <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> This Example does ſufficiently illuſtrate what I am deſigning it for, notwithſtanding the Metal upon the Evaporation of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,</hi> may be found in the bottom. A thing I no more doubted of, then I do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99554:45"/>the reſidence of the Minerals of this <hi>Spaw,</hi> upon the Evaporation of the Water.</p>
            <p>In (<hi>P.</hi> 15.) he proceeds to examine the fourth way,<note place="margin">Minerals joyned to Water by Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> whereby I ſay a Water may imbibe the Nature and Vertue of a Mineral or Metal, and that is by <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> changing the Subſtance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral into Water, and this I ſay in my Book is, when the Mineral is of ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quable a Nature, as that 'tis capable of being converted into Water. <note place="margin">☞</note>Here <hi>W. S.</hi> is extreamly ſevere and abuſive, calling it a <hi>Ruſtical Notion,</hi> with a parcel of <hi>baſe language</hi> againſt me, unbecoming a Scholar or a Sober Man. Indeed in my Second Impreſſion I had thought to have left out this, becauſe of its near coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the former, but I was out-run by the Printer, having been abroad ſome dayes. Nevertheleſs I can defend it to be agreeable to reaſon and the expreſſions of the Learned.</p>
            <p>It's plain that a Mineral that is diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble in Water, as <hi>Vitriol, Nitre, Salt,</hi> may be ſo ſully taken into the Water, as that the Water and Mineral are <hi>confuſedly</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99554:46"/>joyned together, every drop of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſomething of the Mineral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and every Particle of them mixed with the Water. And thus any ſort of Mineral Earth diſſolved in Water, may be ſaid to be <hi>confuſedly</hi> joyned to it, ſo as one cannot ſee to the bottom, though with ſtanding a while, or filtration, or evaporation, they may be ſeparated. And thus a little Gall put into this <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, makes it become <hi>confuſed,</hi> while yet the Minerals are in it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Proved by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Learned Writers.</note>Let me now produce the Authority of Learned Writers. <hi>Fallopius</hi> treating of this Subject of Water taking in Metals and Minerals, mentions ſeveral wayes, and one is by <hi>Confuſion</hi> (<hi>De Therm.

               <hi>Alter vero eſt, quod quaedam Aquae ſunt, quae habent quidem Metalla ſuſcepta pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Terrae concavitatibus inter fluen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum; tamen Metalla illa non ſunt cum Aquis iſtis bene commixta,</hi> — <hi>ſed ſunt potius cum Aquis</hi> CONFUSA. To wit, Another way is, that there are ſome Waters, which have in them Metals, which they have taken in as they paſs in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99554:46"/>the Cavities of the Earth, yet thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are not well mixed with thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but are rather <hi>CONF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SED</hi> with the Waters; then he goes on, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas autem quae hoc modo non vere mixta, ſed</hi> CONFUSA <hi>habent in ſe Metalla, plures habemus, &amp; inter alias eſt Aponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED</hi> in them; of which ſort is that which he calls <hi>Aqua Aponitana,</hi> which he ſays is of great uſe and eſteem, and has been ſo of old; and in the ſame Page, <hi>Secundus igitur mixtionis modus eſt, quando Metalla non vere commiſcentur, ſed</hi> CONFUNDUNTUR <hi>cum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae ſubſtantia.</hi> To wit, The ſecond way (ſays he) whereby a Water takes in a Metal, is when the Metals are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly mixed, but <hi>CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDED</hi> with the Subſtance of the Water.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99554:55"/>upon Evaporation I found to be White, and not above 17 Grains in Weight.

            <p>Now that which I infer from hence is, that ſince Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> grants, that this has Vitriol and Iron, and yet calcines White, the other may as well have them, notwithſtanding it doth calcine White; and ſo his main Argument is altogether invalid.</p>

He cannot but think my experience <hi>in re medica</hi> might miniſter to me ſome Obſervations concerning the Nature of them all: but I thought it moſt proper, briefly as I could, to give the ſence of our Principal Authors that treat of them, and particularly of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> as <hi>Galen, Dioſcorides, Serapio, &amp;c.</hi> whom he has not the patience to hear named. I know <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in many places of his Works extolls it to the Stars, and counts all the Medicines in the World in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99554:57"/>uſe, trifles in compariſon of it: but ſuch rancor does he ſhew in all his Writings where he treats of it, that I did not think it worth the while to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Reader with what he ſays, nor to put him in the ſame Rank with thoſe <hi>Princes in Phyſick</hi> that I here mention; eſpecially ſince I did, in that ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of its qualities, compriſe all the eminent properties of Natural Vitriol, concerning which I was to ſpeak; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Learned Readers to the Authors themſelves concerning their further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe I will pleaſe Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> ☜ Ill now refer him to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who will tell him that I have done but as I ought: I mention'd this before, Conſult him therefore (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Aq.

And in what parts or reſpect ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the vertue of Vitriol conſiſts, it matters not much; its enough that we are ſure, that though full ripe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Vitriol be a violent Emetick or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and in no wiſe to be given inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without due correction; yet this in our <hi>Spaw</hi> being unripe and not come to maturity, is not Emetick, but moſt ſafe and full of vertue. And thus alſo does <hi>Fallopius</hi> affirm <hi>(de Metall. cap.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 216.) <hi>Habemus quinetiam aquas qua Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthi ſuccum habent admixtum, qualis est aqua illius Balnei quod vulgo dicitur Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no al Morbo, in agro Volatterrano, quae tamen aqua tantum abeſt ut nocet, ut ad paranda Edelia, ad Balnea conficienda, maxima ſit idonea: aſſumitur etiam in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; ad alios pleroſque uſus adhibetur;</hi> i. e.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99554:59"/>which they feel and handle the Vertues and Properties of Vegetables; ſo likewiſe it ſeems they reach with them to fathom the Nature of Metals.</hi> And then he runs a Riſque of ſcurrilous language againſt thoſe whom he calls Galeniſts and my ſelf; diſcovering rather puerile folly to be laughed at with ſcorn, than any thing that deſerves an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of the Four firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>The Reader is to take notice, That Phyſicians do ordinarily diſcourſe of all Simples, whether Vegetables or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, according to the <hi>Four firſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as they call them, of <hi>Heat, Cold, Drineſs,</hi> and <hi>Moiſture,</hi> of each of which they make 4 <hi>Degrees;</hi> whereby they judge concerning the Temperature of the Simple, and its operation upon the Body of Man, according to thoſe Four Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.

In reſpect of the firſt ☜ qualities he declares it to be cold and dry. But I find a difference among ſome of them concerning its Temperature, as to heat and cold. <hi>Galen</hi> accounts it of the Nature of Earth, and ſo it muſt be cold. (<hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Simpl.</hi>) So <hi>Conciliator,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all agree in it, except <hi>Fallopius (de Metall.)</hi> who holds it to be hot, and that becauſe <hi>Scribonius Largus</hi> preſcribes it in Ulcers of the Bladder, which it cures; yet not as heating, but as drying: and indeed its evident in Moiſt Bodies, that the conſtant uſe thereof doth very much conduce to the drying up of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous moiſture; yea and all the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts go this way. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> wrote 7 Books <hi>de Gradibus,</hi> which begin his 7th Tome; only he owns but 2 <hi>Complexions</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>viz.

He tells what diſcourſe we had at the Well, where what he got by it, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Gentlemen that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſhall now again further make out.</p>
            <p>His deſign he ſaid was to enquire, whether I had made a true report of the Mineral Ingredients of the Water or no, and at the very firſt he reſolved that they were not there: I asked him if he had evaporated the Water to obſerve the Sediment, he ſaid no. Then I told him it was not juſt to paſs a Sentence, till the party arraigned was heard to ſpeak for himſelf. When he came to the Well (I then being abſent) he began to talk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a great many Gentlemen that were drinking the Waters, at the ſame rate that now he writes; and pulled out of his Pockets half a ſcore Glaſſes: The truth is the Gentlemen at the firſt took
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99554:65"/>him to be a <hi>Jugler,</hi> but perceiving his errand, ſent me word, he told me he had brought the ſolutions of the Five Minerals before mentioned in freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with mixing of which he would make an Eſſay if he could imitate the <hi>Spaw.</hi> I told him that the Water had paſſed under the Trial of very <hi>many Learned and Ingenious</hi> Gentlemen, both Phyſitians and others, and I doubted not but would abide his: and further I ſaid that Nature was more compleat in its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, than to be fully imitated by Art.</p>
            <p>I alſo ſaid, That he could not parallel thoſe Minerals which had undergone the Fire, with thoſe that were in the Water that had not paſſed the Fire, nor judge of the one by the other. He ſaid they were naked and bare ſolutions made without Fire; though now in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he ſays, <hi>They were made without STRESS of Fire, and ſo might well be taken to make experiment withal.</hi> But I pray what have we to do here with Fire at all, ſince there is none in the <hi>Spaw;</hi> which certainly muſt alter the caſe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99554:65"/>what he means by <hi>STRESS OF FIRE</hi> I know not, it's an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous expreſſion; even a ſmall degree of heat will ſerve to unlock a Mineral, and diſſolve its compact ſubſtance; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ſpeak ſometimes that which of it ſelf it would not do. And further I told him, that the Accidents to be obſerved in the Water were ſuch, as did proceed from the diſſolution of Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, <hi>not yet come to maturation;</hi> which of neceſſity muſt be far different from thoſe of his, which were made out of <hi>perfect Minerals and Metals,</hi> as I have evinced already out of the Teſtimony of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> (<hi>lib</hi> 3. <hi>de Nat.

            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 38. He ſays the <hi>Vitriol of Iron</hi> made it taſte very like the ſweet <hi>Spaw</hi> at <hi>Knaresbrough;</hi> which for my own part I could not ſay, that there was the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of it to that Water, which I know as well as he, for theſe 20 years together. He then proceeded to try what Tincture the ſolution of Gall would give to the ſolutions of the Minerals he had
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99554:66"/>brought, thereby to imitate the Water of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and he found that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of <hi>Alome and Vitriol,</hi> would both take the like Tincture from Gall, and ſo become clear again by the putting in of Spirit of <hi>Vitriol; By which</hi> ſays <hi>W. S. I demonſtrated to the Doctor what he would not otherwiſe believe, had not his eyes convinced him;</hi> viz. <hi>that the bare ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Calx of Alome having nothing of Iron and Vitriol doth give exactly the ſame alteration;</hi> and hence he infers, that <hi>this Mutation comes from the Alome, and that there is nothing of Vitriol in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a Crack he gives, and yet he burſts not! why, there is not a word in my Book of <hi>Scarbrough Spaw,</hi> that could in any reaſon lead him to make out ſuch a demonſtration; I ſaid indeed and ſo I do confidently ſay ſtill, that it is the Vitriol alone, that being diſſolved by its Mineral Juyce in this Water, takes the Tincture from the Gall. <hi>Ay</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but the ſolution of Alome will do ſo too; therefore there is no Vitriol but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome.</hi> This is a pure <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider that this ſolution he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99554:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>talks of, was made of <hi>Calcined Alome</hi> as himſelf confeſſes in the next, <hi>P.</hi> 39. in theſe words, <hi>Seeing a ſolution of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Alome will do the ſame.</hi> And ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>P.</hi> 40. <hi>By all which it appeared that the ſolution of the Calcined Stone of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome admitted the ſame precipitations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with that of the Spaw.</hi> Now I pray with what Logick can he argue from <hi>Calcined Stone Alome</hi> to this <hi>Aluminous Juyce</hi> that is here in the Water? Had he tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Crude Stone of Alome would qualifie ſimple Spring-Water to take a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from Gall, or impart any ſapor to Water; he had acted according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But the truth is, I have tried it of that ſort of <hi>Alome Mine</hi> which is in the Cliffe near the Well, having broken it to Powder, and infus'd it in Spring-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome hours, and it received no Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from Gall; nay, I did <hi>calcine that very Stone,</hi> and then diſſolv'd it in Spring-Water; and yet it receiv'd no Tincture from the Gall: ſo that I very much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether his <hi>Calcined Alome</hi> of which he made his ſolution were of that Mine or no.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99554:67"/>
            <p> There is at <hi>Whitby</hi> on the ſame Coaſt 12 miles from <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> an <hi>Alome Mine,</hi> out of which Alome is wont to be made, and ſent abroad in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities; in the middle of which a Spring of Freſh Water breaks out, having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 12 fathom of the Mine above it, and how many 12s below it let him enquire; this I have got Captain <hi>Francis Cummin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> a Miniſter, both ingenious Gentlemen and of good repute at <hi>Whitby,</hi> to try whether it would receive any Tincture from Gall at the Fountain, and they do both aſſure me it doth not. They alſo ſent me a Glaſs Bottle of the ſame to <hi>York,</hi> which I tried with Gall and it changed not at all. Nay, I do with them further averr, that it is like ordinary Spring-Water, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken no Vapor, Odor, or Sapor from the Mine, and being evaporated, it yielded no Sediment: I calcin'd alſo a piece of this Mine which I had from <hi>Whitby,</hi> and put it into Spring-Water with Gall; but it received no Tincture: ſo that I cannot find either the one or the other to receive a Tincture of Gall.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99554:67"/>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Alome tinctures not with Gall.</note>Now this doth plainly evince that its not from <hi>Alome</hi> that this Water at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> takes its Tincture, but from ſome other Mineral, and that in all likelihood muſt be the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> unleſs we can find how to fix it upon another.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore now enquire whether <hi>Iron</hi> will ſuffice to give it this Tincture with Gall: If ſo, then another Spring that paſſes through <hi>Iron</hi> muſt receive a Tincture, but that it will not; <hi>Ergo,</hi> not from <hi>Iron</hi> does this take its Tincture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Nor Iron.</note>There is an <hi>Iron</hi> Mine near <hi>Barnſley</hi> upon the Edge of <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> where great ſtore of <hi>Iron</hi> is melted, out of which runs a Spring of Freſh Water. This, I procured Mr. <hi>William Cotton</hi> who is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer of the Iron Work, to try if it would change Colour with Gall; he writes me, that it did not change the Colour at all: He ſent me alſo a Glaſs Bottle of the Water, which I tried with Gall, but it changed nothing at all; neither being evaporated did it yield any Sediment: notwithſtanding that he writes that he obſerved it to have ſomething of the Taſte of <hi>Scarbrough Spaw</hi> at the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99554:68"/>Fountain. He writes alſo that to make a further Trial, he ſtaied till they had got a Pit at the bottom of the Mine, and ſo he cauſed a hole to be made under the bottom Stone, for the Water to fall into, and ſtand till it was clear, and then took and tried it, but it received no alteration from the Gall: He ſent me alſo ſome of the Mine it ſelf which I calcin'd, and put into Water, to ſee if that would give any Tincture by the addition of Gall, but it did not. So then, if neither <hi>Alome</hi> nor <hi>Iron</hi> will do it, then it remains that <hi>Vitriol</hi> is that that gives the Tincture,<note place="margin">Nor Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</note> unleſs <hi>Nitre</hi> will do it; which neither he contends for, nor any one upon trial ſhall find to do it; and the ſame may I ſay of Salt, which is the Fifth Ingredient; from all which it follows that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is in a grand miſtake, to think that <hi>Alome</hi> can contribute to this Colour by Gall.</p>
            <p>Furthermore (as I have already made out) this Water being carried abroad, or left ſome while to ſtand in an open Veſſel, will receive no Tincture from Gall, as alſo it will have laid aſide its Acidity, which methink is an argument of ſome
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99554:68"/>force to prove, that both theſe Qualities or Properties come from one and the ſame Cauſe (to wit) <hi>Vitriol:</hi> which I ſuſpect to be in its volatile parts imbibed in the Water, and that the Sediment which remains after Evaporation is rather the product of the reſt of the Minerals, than the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> for elſe I ſee no reaſon but while any thing of the ſubſtance of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is there, it ſhould keep its Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and alſo receive a mutation from the Gall.</p>
            <p>And alſo I infer, that if that Tincture come from <hi>Alome,</hi> then certainly that which he by and by calls the Aluminous Salt, which he makes the eſſence of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> ſhould give the Black Tincture to the Gall, ſo long as it remains in the Water. From what has been ſaid, it alſo follows that ordinary Spring-Water takes no Salt at all, and but little of Sapor or Vapor or Odor from <hi>perfect Mineral of Alome or Iron:</hi> Indeed what it would do if it were made Corroſive by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of <hi>Vitrioline Juyce</hi> I cannot ſo eaſily determine. From whence alſo it follows that if Minerals and Metals be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99554:69"/>but in <hi>Solutis principiis</hi> or their Concrete Juyces, even Simple Spring-Water will be ſufficient to imbibe them, without any neceſſity of <hi>Helmonts Primum Ens,</hi> which therefore I have with good reaſon exploded before; and if any doubt be made of that which yet I proved to be the opinion of good Authors, then here is the Juyce of Vitriol, which will not fail to do it.</p>

            <p> Well!

            <p> Concerning his Quaerie, <hi>How I would demonſtate thoſe to be Vitrioline Spirits which were loſt in the Waters carrying at diſtance?</hi> I returned the ſame Anſwer which here I have already laid down, and need not to repeat; onely to that which I urged out of <hi>Fallopius</hi> I'l ſubjoyn the Opinion of Dr <hi>Heers</hi> in his <hi>Spadacrene</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 44.) where he is proving the German Spaws to have imbibed Vitriol, <hi>Conjecturam hanc duae rationes firmant, utraque nifallor evidentiſſima,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe two reaſons, ſays he, do evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Opinion; <hi>One is becauſe where ſuch acid Waters are found, there is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally found ſomething of the Minera of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol near at hand;</hi> and thus it is at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> within Sixſcore Paces of the <hi>Spaw</hi> where <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſweats out of the Cliffe. His other reaſon is, <hi>from the eminent aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that is in Vitriol, ſutable to that which ſuch Waters have imbibed, wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Chymists themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that no man but he that has a ſnotty Noſe will preſume to deny it.</hi> Cujus naſum pituita obſtruxerit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99554:71"/>
            <p> (P. 46.) <hi>But an ingenious Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, asked the Doctor, Whether if the Water was ſealed up in a Glaſs Bottle her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically, and ſo carried abroad, it would be altered by carriage or no? He anſwered he thought it would; If ſo,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>S. then it was not from any volatility of parts, becauſe it was ſealed up; and ſo not from the loſs of the Vitrioline Spirits.</hi> It is very true I ſaid ſo, and now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial I am ſure it is ſo;<note place="margin">Vitrioline Spirits in the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
               </note> nor is his conſequence of any validity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary; for if there be any loſs, it muſt be of the <hi>volatile</hi> parts, there being nothing elſe that can be loſt; ſince it is ſuppoſed to be ſealed; yet ſays Mr. <hi>S.</hi> it is not from the loſs of Vitrioline Spirits, but it is an <hi>Aporrhaea Mineralis;</hi> whether Vitrioline or Aluminous. It ſeems hereby that he is in doubt which of the two; but certainly I judge it from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> ſince both the acidity and the Vitrioline ſmell, and the tinging quality will be all loſt together: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will all keep longer, being ſealed up in Glaſs Bottles, than in Woodden Veſſels, and therefore I did adviſe in my
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99554:71"/>Book that it ſhould rather be carried in Bottles well ſtopt, although in theſe alſo it will not keep long, but be ſubject to Putrefaction, and become whitiſh in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>Nor let any man think it ſtrange, that though ſtopped it ſhould yet loſe its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſince <hi>Frambeſarius</hi> reports as much of the <hi>Sauvenir</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 12 <hi>Lagena</hi> to be carried but two dayes journey (which is near ſo many Gallons of Engliſh Meaſure, taking a <hi>Lagena</hi> to contain 6 Sextaries, and a Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to be 20 Ounces) and that in Bottles well ſealed up, there wanted to every <hi>Lagena</hi> one Glaſs of its meaſure, which probably might be half a Pint, through the loſs of the Volatile Spirits; and the Water became like Common Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>While I in my Book diſcourſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extracting the Minerals that are in the Water, I ſaid (<hi>P.</hi> 10) they may be found either by <hi>DISTIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING</hi> off the Water, or otherwiſe by <hi>evaporating</hi> the Water away in a Skellit over the Fire.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous.</note> He exclaims (<hi>P.</hi> 47) <hi>of my Tools, that they are very rude und of a low rank (to wit) a Skellit, a Culinary Fire, but not a word of a Glaſs ſtill, which an Ingenious Artiſt would have choſen,</hi> &amp;c.

               <note place="margin">☞</note>Is it not enough that I ſay they may be extracted <hi>BY DISTILLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99554:72"/>but muſt I needs tell what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal my Still is made of?

            <p>Yet let him do what he can by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo volatile are theſe ſpirits that they will yet be gone, as upon trial I have often obſerved. The ſame did <hi>Doctor French</hi> diſcover in his Diſtilling of the <hi>Sweet Spaw at Knareshrough,</hi> which though he did it in a Glaſs ſtill, luted and cloſed up carefully in the ioynts thereof,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99554:73"/>ſo as the ſpirit of Wine could not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate out thereat; yet ſo ſubtil were the Vitrioline Spirits, and ſo volatile, that he ſays they are ſooner ſublim'd than the Water, and do penetrate even the Glaſs it ſelf, or the Lute, and he believes that neither Glaſs nor Lute can hold them.

            <p>As for what he ſaith concerning the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick or Vomiting Property</hi> of <hi>Common Vitriol,</hi> it is altogether extraneous to our Subject, and I have ſaid enough to that point already.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſays, <hi>I bluſht not to inſtance in Spirit of Vitriol, that we uſe it in Juleps and Cordials, and tis not Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> — I anſwer, Nor need I, ſince the main part of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> in this Water is the Spirit, as I have now proved; which is as much, yea and far more diluted with the Water wherein it is imbibed, than the force of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> is corrected by the vehement heat of the Fire, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling of the Spirit: And what follows in that Section, wherein he runs a riſque concerning the <hi>Vomiting property of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> is altogether pillaged out of <hi>Helment,</hi> after whoſe Pipe I find him conſtantly dancing; uſing his very words as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as if he were the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and alſo nothing to the point in hand.</p>

            <p> (<hi>P.</hi> 50.) He returns to our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and particularly about the <hi>Nitre,</hi> which I had affirmed in my Book (<hi>P.</hi> 13.) to be of all the Minerals the <hi>moſt predominant;</hi> ſhooting into Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickles or <hi>Stiria,</hi> which is the peculiar form of Nitre; whereby it is diſtinguiſht from all other Minerals whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of <hi>Nitre</hi> in the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>I queried with the Doctor</hi> (ſays he) <hi>how he came to know that Nitre was an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and the moſt predominant.</hi> — Here he forges a confuſed Narrative, which was never in my Heart, nor on my Tongue to ſay (but perhaps it may be a lapſe of his Memory.) — I made it out from that Analogy and Reſemblance that is betwixt the <hi>Minerals</hi> that remain after the Evaporation of the Water, and the <hi>Nitre</hi> that breaks out of the Cliffe within 6 or 8 yards of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which is white like a hoar-froſt in hot and dry weather, but is waſht off by every ſhower of Rain; both that and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals extracted out of the Water ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alike in <hi>Stirias,</hi> and alſo agreeing in Taſte.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:99554:74"/>
            <p> But that this was Nitre at that time, he confidently denied; He ſaid indeed it was nothing but an <hi>Aluminous Salt;</hi> but when I urged that <hi>Alome</hi> does not ſhoot in <hi>Stirias,</hi> and upon that very account that it could be nothing but <hi>Nitre,</hi> then he would have it to come from the <hi>Air of the Sea</hi> which has <hi>Nitre</hi> in it. I replied that then the whole Sea Coaſt ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with it, which we ſee it doth not. Hence it follows that it can be nothing but <hi>Nitre,</hi> which proceeds out of the Earth, that is <hi>exceeding Nitrous.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet is this <hi>Nitre</hi> diſcernable in every part of the Cliffe throughout, but runs in certain Veins, and much more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near the Well.</p>
            <p>That this is Nitre ſeveral <hi>learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> have been abundantly ſatisfied, and thoſe both of <hi>London and elſewhere;</hi> the ſhooting of <hi>Nitre</hi> into <hi>Stirias</hi> being as peculiar to that Mineral, as the form of any Plant is to all of the ſame kind. This and the reſt of the Minerals, which are apparent upon this Cliffe, have put many Naturaliſts into no ſmall amazement; which made Dr. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ☜
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99554:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>an <hi>Eminent Phyſitian</hi> and <hi>Chymiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>He thought it was the moſt fertile Bank in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him further know, that all the Earth about <hi>Scarbrough</hi> is full of <hi>Nitre,</hi> from whence it is that the Meadows about the Town are more eminently fertile, than any other that I have obſerved upon the Sea-Coaſt; which gave too much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to an <hi>Ingenious Gentleman</hi> a Friend of mine, to begin a Project there of Making Nitre, which for his own ſake I wiſh had ſucceeded according to his expectation; but the truth is, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but an <hi>imperfect Nitre,</hi> eſpecially that which is extracted out of the Water, and ſo in <hi>refractis viribus,</hi> and alſo joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the other Salts, which perhaps do enfeeble it more.</p>
            <p>And yet I have obſerved many years ago this Sediment of the Water, having been laid aſide in a cool place ſome dayes, to ſhoot into <hi>Stiria</hi>'s half an Inch long, eſpecially after Calcination, Filtration, and Separation from the groſſer parts of the Minerals.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99554:75"/>
            <p> This I have expreſly touched on in my Book, and did alſo ſufficiently urge it in our Conference at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed nothing with this Gentleman, though it was abundantly ſatisfactory to all elſe that were by; and yet it ſeems ev'n now while he writ this, he was of the ſame mind; <hi>That theſe Volatile Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Particles,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>which float in the Aire, are magnetically attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the aluminous Salt that is in the Body of the Minerals, extracted from the Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo by the Mineral Earth of Alome which is upon the Cliffe: and conſequently that which is in the Water is nothing but an aluminous Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is ſuch a truth as he endeavors to illuſtrate (in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 53) in a long Diſcourſe with ſeveral Experiments; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all which, and a large Harangue of hard words (fit only to breed admiration in the ignorant, and laughter in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) he gives us his definitive Sentence in ſhort by way of Recapitulation, in theſe words (<hi>P.</hi> 61.) <hi>The Eſurine acid Salt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in its ſolution got a ſlight touch of a Vein or Minera of Iron, and paſſing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99554:76"/>through a rocky Mineral Glebe of Alome, becomes ſpecificated in an aluminous Salt, with which the Water of the Quick-Spring is impregnate, which makes the Spaw we diſcourſe of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if his Aſſertion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which by all thoſe Experiments he endeavors to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate be falſe, as I am certain it is, and ſhall prove from his own Conceſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, then there needs no more to ſatisfie the World that I was all this while in the right. And if ſo, then is not mine Antagoniſt an able man indeed, that can thus draw <hi>Quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> plainly to prove that which is clearly falſe? One would think almoſt this <hi>Batchelour</hi> were playing the <hi>Sophiſter</hi> again, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deceive the World with a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> which yet a Wiſeman would have couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more cunningly in the premiſſes, and ta'n care to end with a <hi>plauſible Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> but juſt thus we have him 20 times in this Book building upon a ſandy foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, illuſtrating by far-fetcht Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that which to every mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is evidently falſe, and from falſe and miſtaken premiſſes drawing neceſſary Concluſions.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:99554:76"/>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99554:77"/>ſpurns at them; but rather to convince him with the Verdict of the Chymiſts, whom he ought better to have underſtood, and cannot deny.</p>

Now his Book was then well-nigh printed, ſo as he could not recall it; and therefore was forced to bring it in an Appendix at the latter end, and ſtudy out words to blind the unwary and ignorant Reader. This Relation I have from the Gentleman himſelf, when yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is not ſo ingenuous as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Director (for he taught him the whole proceſs that he lays down in the Epilogue) but on the contrary falls into a ſimple Rant (<hi>P.</hi> 361.) as if <hi>he was the firſt that has made ſo many ſeparations of the Minerals.</hi> Yea and I can ſay he <hi>is the firſt that ever denied them</hi> of the Gentlemen of Art that ever came to the

I confeſs this is above my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conceive, I ſhall leave it to the Reader to believe as he ſees cauſe. For my own part I think both parts of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion are doubtful; though indeed it is bravely reſolv'd of the Gentleman on the ſudden, to find out the cauſe of the Seas Saltneſs, which has in all Ages put the moſt grave Philoſophers to a puzzle. I do verily think that all the foſſile Salt in the Body of the Earth (which we ſee is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely found) if it were diſſolved, will not ſerve to ſupply a twentieth part of the Salt that is in the Sea; the ſixteenth part whereof being a Body of Salt, as I have tried at <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> every Pint having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one Ounce in this our Northern Sea, and in the Southern Seas it is far more ſtrong of the Salt: Beſides the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks thought this came far ſhort of an adaequate cauſe, and thereupon they fly to the torrefaction of the Sun.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if the Saltneſs of the Sea ſhould proceed from the foſsile Salt of the Earth, then being an extraneous quality to

But farther let him know that in Fevers, its ordinary for Phyſicians to obſerve their Patients ſo refreſhed immediately upon the taking of a due quantity of blood, that Nature, that before lay groveling as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of the Diſeaſe, becomes an abſolute Conquerour over the Diſeaſe, and able to diſcharge its functions; (and this I have ſeen a thouſand times) which could not be, if loſs of blood were ſo great an impoveriſhing of the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as he ſpeaks of.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Caſe of Major <hi>J. St.</hi>
               </note>Here I think fit to tell the Story that he aims at, which I have liberty to do, and name the Party if I pleaſe; but it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that many hundreds do know whom I mean. <hi>Major J. St.</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of note in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> of a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, and in the flower of his age, did for more than a year labour under an <hi>Anorexia,</hi> or Loſs of Appetite and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, ſo as I have often heard his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady ſay, If ſhe had been confined to his flint in eating during all the time, ſhe muſt needs have been ſtarved. At laſt the Gentleman got a Surfet, to which was joyned a moſt Violent Fever and a continual vomiting of what ever he took.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99554:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now was I conſulted, and ſaw cauſe to give a Vomit, and let blood, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to do many things, for the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the violent Symptomes and the Cure of the Diſeaſe, which was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be very eaſily done (as the Reader may gueſs) ſince it had been ſo long in taking root. In a few dayes the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fever in all its Symptomes abated, only being in Winter, it degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Tertian. This required a reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vomit, and Bleeding and Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according as I ſaw cauſe, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other remedies; whereby I daily gained ground, and had occaſion to make very hopeful Prognoſticks: although the Diſeaſe ran out unto two Moneths at the leaſt. While I was thus acting for my Patient, this <hi>Mr. Simpſon</hi> procured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be introduced one day to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, by a Gentleman who was an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Aſſociate of his, and preſſed the Major to take the advice of this <hi>RARE CHYMIST,</hi> whoſe Medicines he ſaid would ſoon make a Cure. The Major told them both he was abundantly ſatisfied in what I was
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99554:97"/>doing, and bid Mr. <hi>S.</hi> take his time.</p>
            <p>Here I could wiſh that all Phyſicians of a more regular ſtamp than this young man, that have taken their Degrees in Phyſick, or otherwiſe are legally licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, were not alſo too prone to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their Profeſſion, in begging Practice and rudely intruding themſelves into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens buſineſs, without any Call, eſpecially in the latter end of a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which is the Cuſtome of ſome. But at this Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> was very much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this is the buſineſs he aims at. Some few dayes after the Gentleman met me at the Majors Chamber, and asked me what I thought of the event of all, and what further I would do? I (knowing from the Major himſelf his deſign, and his good will towards me) told him I had good grounds of hope of recovery, and further <hi>(it may be not ſo gratefully to him)</hi> ſaid, I would do as I ſhould ſee cauſe <hi>pro re nata,</hi> even as I had done all the while.</p>
            <p>And herein I followed the Counſel of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (2 <hi>lib. Aph.</hi> 52.) <hi>Si medico ſecundum rectam rationem facienti, cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99554:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>non ſtatim ſuccedat, non eſt tamen mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda Methodus, quamdiu id reſtat quod a principio viſum eſt. viz.</hi> If while a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician doth act, according to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Cure does not preſently ſucceed, he ought not yet to change his Method, ſo long as that remains, which was ſeen from the beginning. And whereas <hi>W. S.</hi> urges that all this while I gave him not one good <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 175.) though I am not bound to be accountable to him, yet on this occaſion I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſet him right, and do aſſure him that during this courſe, I gave him three times as many Diaphoreticks, as I did of any Medicine whatſoever, as my Bills this day extant in the Apothecaries Shop do teſtifie, and the Patient himſelf now in perfect health doth witneſs.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt know this Gentleman who would have introduced <hi>W. S.</hi> was a <hi>Pſeudo-Chymiſt,</hi> who had waſted great ſummes of money in making Chymical Experiments, and a Principal Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of Mr. <hi>Simpſons,</hi> and had a great hand ☜ in compiling of this Book againſt me, as himſelf ſeveral times told the Major, while
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99554:98"/>it was in <hi>fieri,</hi> bragging how much they would wound me by it; concerning which the Major is ready to give Oath, if there were occaſion: But within a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after the Gentleman himſelf fell ſick, and ſo phyſicked himſelf with <hi>his own Chymical Preparations,</hi> that he ſoon cured himſelf of all Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> Upon the whole matter I admire at the folly of my Antagoniſt, that he would urge any thing herein as an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, ſeeing he could not but know, that the Patient ſoon after did throughly recover, long before his Book went to the Preſs. But why do I trouble my ſelf to rectifie <hi>W.S.</hi> in his groſs miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cure of Fevers, whereby he will know more, than hitherto by <hi>all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reading?</hi> ſave onely that I would let him know, that the Galeniſts (whom he ſo uncivilly ſpurns at) have good ground for every thing they do in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their buſineſs, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it not; and that their endeavours are by the Bleſſing of God found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceſsful, even in the moſt arduous Caſes.</p>

            <p> But at length <hi>He grants that the ſingle breathing of a Vein, or Artery, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Phlebotomy, may and doth ſometimes help in a Fever;</hi> I am glad the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is convinced now at length; its not long ſince he was of another mind, for about three years ago when he writ his <hi>Zenexton Antipeſtilentiale,</hi> he ſeverely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt bleeding, even in <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies;</hi> there he ſays (<hi>P.</hi> 41.) that <hi>it is unneceſſary in all Fevers, though if any, the Pleuriſie may ſeem to plead a neceſſity but to whom? onely to the Galeniſts, who know no better remedy.</hi> I am afraid ſome ☜ poor men paid dear for his Learning. But I wonder what he means by ſingle breathing of a Vein; this is the doing it but once, and in a ſmall quantity, which will not alwayes ſerve the turn, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Diſeaſe we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> in which Caſe <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> adviſes to do it in caſe of extremity twice a day, and ſo on, according to the magnitude of the Diſeaſe and ſtrength of the Patient, as I my ſelf had occaſion to do it this laſt week, even to 5 or 6 times; while no Diaphoretick, Vegetable or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99554:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>or other Applications inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, would take off the Pungent Pains, and that with excellent ſucceſs. As for <hi>Moderate Phlebotomy,</hi> that may be, and yet be done more than once, even often, and be accounted but <hi>Moderate</hi> if the Caſe require it; and better it is to take often than too much at once.</p>
            <p>(P. 108.) <hi>I confeſs</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I never order Phlebotomy oftner than once in a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that with reluctancy bemoaning my ſelf.</hi> It ſeems Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is a very <hi>PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L PHYSICIAN.</hi> Well! its enough he ſhall not teach me, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I believe he has had many partners with him in that ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay further I have been with ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who in Pleuriſies have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a Galenical Method of twice bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ready for the third time, and the Fever as high as at the firſt; whom after all this, I have cured with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick Specifick once or twice repeated; and ſometimes one ſingle Doſe thereof has done the feat.</hi> — Speak out man where was this?

            <p>Then he goes on and ſays, <hi>That bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth diametrically oppoſe the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Digeſtions and Vital Spirits, becauſe it robs the blood of its treaſure, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiouſly ſtealing away its balſome, and debilitates the Vital Spirits, making them lower their Top-ſails,</hi> &amp;c. — Even juſt ſo a Ship in a Storm over-laden with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Goods, for the ſaving whereof ſome part is thrown over-board, is much injured by being robbed of her treaſure, whilſt after it ſhe can hoyſt up her Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, when the Mizen was too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>(P. 109.) <hi>As in Acute, ſo in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, the frequent uſe of Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy is not commendable nor proper.</hi> — If he had told what Chronical Diſeaſes he had meant, I ſhould probably have joyn'd iſſue, for ſome do neceſſarily require it, as the Caſe may be put, and others as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99554:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeverely interdict it. And therefore he ought to have ſpecified his Caſe in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before he had condemned it. The <hi>Scurvy</hi> is a Chronical Diſeaſe, and doth require bleeding, if there be Strength and a Plethorical Conſtitution, and other things premiſed that are adviſed by the Learned. So is the <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> in both which Caſes it is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>

               <note place="margin">Of Thirſt in Fevers.</note>(<hi>P.</hi> 110.) Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is Retrograde in his Diſcourſe, reſuming his Topick of <hi>Thirſt,</hi> which of all Symptomes is moſt urging; <hi>which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>according to the Galeniſts proceeds from a hot and dry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the Stomach, to anſwer which Indication, they moſt frequently order cool and moiſt things; which if the cauſe of thirſt were as they ſuppoſe, they would have a moſt facile way of Cure, in caſe that were true,</hi> Contraria ſuis contrariis curantur.— And then he falls on as his manner was before to inveigh againſt Cool Drinks. Well! Tis no great matter, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will never hurt Phyſician while he keeps in this mind, and never profit Patient. I have already expreſſed the neceſſity and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99554:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>uſefulneſs of Cooling Drinks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'l not further enlarge, onely do ſay, that if it be ſingly a hot and dry Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at the Stomach, its neceſſary to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it with Drinks that are Cold and Moiſt, as the moſt preſent remedy, to wit, <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> although the end doth not alwayes preſently follow the moſt rational means.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Contraria contrariis curantur.</note>As for the Rule that he refers to, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria contrariis curantur.</hi> It is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a right ſenſe. Nature it ſelf is <hi>Morborum Curatrix,</hi> and therefore thoſe things which do ſtrengthen Nature, have a great influence into the Cure of Diſeaſes, although they act not thus by any contrariety of quality in reſpect of the Diſeaſe; but from a ſimilitude of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; for the ſupplying of Natures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, which having now got new

            <p>Again, There are ſome Diſeaſes that ſeem to be cured by their like; thus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting by a Vomit, and purging by a Purge, although theſe are not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per accidens,</hi> by the taking away of thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Why! The very Cooling Juleps which we were juſt now treating of, do further Tranſpiration through the inſenſible pores of the Skin, and provoke Sweat many times to the quenching of the Violent Heat of Fevers, as I have found many times, when all his dry Diaphoreticks would do nothing.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99554:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Doſe, than be in danger of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Conſtitution of Patients is different, which he that is the immediate Phyſician is moſt fit to judge of, and not another, who underſtands not all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that occur; and therefore it were better that others and particularly Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would forbear to cenſure that which they know not, but truſt every man in his own buſineſs: Poſſibly Mr. <hi>S.</hi> might at ſome time look into an Apothecaries Shop, and there might ſee into ſome of our Bills, where 3 or 4 Grains might be ordered for a Child, or for ſome very feeble Patient ſubject to Colliquation, where a Phyſician for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, had preſcribed ſome ſmall quantity of this Medicine, increaſing his Doſe with another ſort of <hi>Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> but what is this to him to tell the World of it?</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Schroderus</hi> (who is a Learned Chymiſt) accounts the Doſe to be from 10 Grains to 25 at the moſt. (<hi>Pharm. Med. Chym<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.) though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> amounts to 60. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

(<hi>Mantis Hermet.</hi> P. 800.) Is it not therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that we ſhould be careful how we uſe this Chymical Preparation, and by all means ſo to do it, as it may be ſafe and yet ſucceſsful? Now this Medicine is uſed in Malignant Fevers or otherwiſe, when we would provoke Sweat; but if it be not well prepared and purged from its <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Sulphur,</hi> what woful work would there be, if inſtead of ſweating the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould fall into vomiting or purging. <hi>Ay but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is of my own prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore I dare more confide in it.</hi>— Therefore indeed he may the better give it, but the main Queſtion is, Whether the Patient may the better take it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if <hi>Antim. Diaph.</hi> may contract a malignant quality <hi>from the Air,</hi> were it not ſafer to give it in a leſs quantity?
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99554:105"/>and may not there alſo be danger, leſt the <hi>Acid Humors</hi> in the Body ſhould make it reſume its Malignity as well as the Air? Upon the account of all which, let wiſe men judge whether acts more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, he that gives 60 Grains, or he that gives 8 or 10.</p>
            <p>For further ſatisfaction concerning this thing, I refer the Reader to what I have to ſay in my Animadverſions on the 195th Page of this his Book.</p>
            <p>(P. 115.) <hi>He proceeds to treat of what Diſeaſes the Spaw at</hi> Scarbrough <hi>cures,</hi> viz. The <hi>Scurvy, Dropſie, Stone, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, Jaundice, Hypochondriack Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Cachexia, Womens Diſeaſes,</hi> &amp;c. — I confeſs I cannot but wonder to ſee the confidence of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who knows nothing at all of theſe things but by my Book, no more than he that lives at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and has read my Book there. Indeed this is the onely thing wherein I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him, in that he gives me Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, although ſometimes he makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Text will not bear, and by a multiplicity of fooliſh new-coyn'd words, doth obſcure that (even) to <hi>ſome
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99554:106"/>wiſe and learned men,</hi> which was plain and obvious to Common Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> But upon the grounds he yet goes on, I declare it impoſſible that the <hi>Spaw</hi> ſhould have ſuch Vertue as to cure theſe Diſeaſes; for if we obſerve, he owns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Mineral property to be in it, but an <hi>Eſurine Aluminous Salt</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 116. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.) Now whether we conſider the properties of Alome, as I have inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (in the 145. Page of <hi>Scarb.

            <p>But to amend the matter, <hi>He would have it ſeconded by other penetrating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of his own preparation.</hi>— Why! I can aſſure him, the Cures I mention, were done without any of his preparations, and the like probably may be done again; although not without ſome other helps ſometimes, as the Caſes may require.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:99554:106"/>
            <p> (<hi>P.</hi> 118.

And if he will diſtill or evaporate away the water of thoſe that drink of the <hi>Spaw,</hi> as I have done, he ſhall find a ſlimy Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, highly impregnated with an Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Salt.</p>
            <p>(P. 119.) He tells, That <hi>There are ſome Cauſes of a Dropſie, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all Medicines, except the nobleſt of Chymical Arcana</hi>'s— Really it's great pity he had not found thoſe Chymical Arcana's when <hi>Robert Beford</hi> was in his hands in this Diſeaſe (of whom I made
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99554:107"/>mention before) whom if he had let alone, he might probably have ſeen cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chymical Arcana's.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lunar Pills.</note>(<hi>P.</hi> 120) He reckons up ſeveral of his Chymical Arcana's, which he counts highly of for the Cure of the Dropſie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which are the <hi>Pilulae Lunares,</hi> of which <hi>he confeſſes, he never found any conſiderable ſucceſs, and for the ſake of the</hi> Aqua Fortial <hi>he rather adviſes againſt.</hi>— <note place="margin">☞</note> I am much afraid <hi>poor Beford</hi> had of theſe his <hi>Lunar Pills,</hi> which he took for Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Arcana's, for his Complaint was of ſuch an Heat and Corroſion in his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Bowels, as if he had taken his <hi>Aqua Fortial</hi> Spirits. But it's well he does confeſs his fault, and I wiſh he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and not make Experiments of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Medicines upon the Bodies of Men, to the hazard of their Lives, in an Empirical uſe of unſafe and ill-corrected Mineral Medicines, imperfectly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> which he knows not either how to make or uſe.</p>

            <p>But beſides this its utterly falſe, for no ſuch thing was ever ſaid or writ by any man that deſerves the name of a Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, nor if you mark does he cite any of their Writings in the Caſe, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in any thing that he objects againſt them, but frames Arguments out of

            <p>In this buſineſs I'l refer the Learned and Judicious Reader to my late inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend and Collegue <hi>Doctor Prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,</hi> in that excellent Treatiſe of his <hi>de Morbis Mulierum,</hi> where he treats (in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) of this Diſeaſe; he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up the Opinions both of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Modern Writers, concerning the Cauſes of theſe Hyſterical Fits, but not one ſyllable of <hi>Windineſs in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> to be the cauſe of them. At laſt he concludes of two principal Cauſes from whence they proceed ordinarily (<hi>P.</hi> 207.) <hi>Frequenter itaque cauſa eſt ſeminis corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, ut in viduis &amp; libidinoſis Mulieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſi Viri amplexibus fraudentur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingit.</hi> And this he ſhews to agree with what <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Epicurus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Rondeletius,</hi> and others have writtten. Another cauſe which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns (<hi>P.</hi> 209.) is, <hi>Quilibet humor in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero putreſcens, tetrum venenatumque vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem expirat.

            <p>I ſhall need to ſay no more, but refer ☜ it to the Ingenuous Reader to judge of the Spirit of this Man, and who can be ſafe from blaſting, while ſuch a malevolent breath as this blows upon him.</p>
            <p>(<hi>P.</hi> 132.) Mr. S. <hi>treating of the Green Sickneſs in Maids,</hi> ſays, <hi>it will not bend to the ſingle help of this</hi> Spaw, &amp;c. <hi>where little or no body of a Mineral is found.</hi> —</p>
            <p>Let the wiſe Reader judge whether this man underſtands what he treats of, that ſays this <hi>Spaw</hi> has little or no Body of Minerals in it, when five Quarts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at the leaſt an Ounce of Minerals, and in dry years ten Drams, while the uſual Doſe for Women in this Caſe is three Quarts of Water, and ſometimes more.</p>

            <p>It is well known to the Learned that many Antient Writers have treated of Chymiſtry, as <hi>Avicen, Rhaſis, Albuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Haly,</hi> &amp;c. in Arabick: <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Myrepſus, Zoſymus, Marcellus, Heliodorus,</hi> &amp;c. in Greek: and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Latine Authors, that would be tedious to reckon up for theſe two or three laſt Centuries, no man of learning or worth ever opening his mouth or uſing his Pen againſt it, although ſome are more affected towards it than others; and truly methink every man ſhould be left to his liberty in that point, to uſe or not uſe this or that method as he ſhall ſee cauſe, without being impoſed on or cenſured by another, ſo long as he

            <p>Nay I could make it out if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the moſt eminent profeſt Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts have ſpoken honourably in their Writings of this Art of Chymiſtry, and preſcribed a number of Medicines ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">No diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned.</note>And as the Galeniſts approve both in their Writings and Practice of Chymical Medicines, ſo the moſt learned among the Chymiſts do uſe the Galenical. Thus <hi>Zwelfer</hi> has made his Comment upon the <hi>Pharmac. Auguſtana,</hi> and left one of his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99554:113"/>own, which he calls <hi>Pharmacopaeia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> which are as full of all ſorts of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, <hi>viz.</hi> Syrupes, Diſtilled Waters, Electuaries, Extracts, Pills, Powders, Cordial Species, Lohochs, Trochisks, Oyls, Ointments, and Cerates, as our <hi>London Diſpenſatory,</hi> and made out of the very ſame matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, though Mr. <hi>S.</hi> cries them down, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (<hi>P.</hi> 161.) <hi>That there are not above a ſcore that are good for any thing.</hi> Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Schroderus</hi> and Excellent Chymiſt has writ another after the ſame Method. Likewiſe <hi>Hadrianus a Mynſicht,</hi> ſo <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius, Renodaeus, Crollius, Hartman,</hi> go this way, deſcribing Medicines both out of the Vegetables, and Minerals, and Metals: all which we know and make uſe of in our Practice, at leaſt ſo many as we approve of to be good and wholeſome. And why may not this be done without reproaching one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>Indeed of late ſome Controverſies have been ſtarted betwixt ſome who call themſelves Chymiſts and others, but in thoſe it plainly appears the Chymiſts
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99554:114"/>have been the Aggreſſors, and the other only defenſive: Or elſe they have riſen from ſome perſonal quarrel, in which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ☜wiſe and learned men on both ſides have not thought fit to intereſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but have rather privately endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to compoſe their differences, and ſo to keep the Peace in the Faculty. And even in theſe alſo (if I miſtake not) the Chymiſts have begun the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>And thus it is betwixt my Adverſary and me, while I had never diſobliged ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him or any man elſe, nor meddled with any thing in Controverſie, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Diſpute about the Original of Springs, which I modeſtly carried on by Argument, without any the leaſt perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reflexion upon any man that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, leaving every man to believe as he ſaw cauſe; and in treating of the ☜Mineral Ingredients and Vertues of the <hi>Spaw</hi> was modeſt in all my Aſſertions; even then and therefore does he flie in my face with uncivil perſonal reflections, and takes thereby occaſion to throw dirt in the face of the moſt Learned Phyſicians in the World, and the Univerſities, as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99554:114"/>we ſhall ſee by and by: and then to make a Vindication of Chymical Phyſick as if it were oppoſed. And all this meerly to carry on a deſign of over-turning the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Practice, and advancing his own way of Practice; which whether it be ſo ſafe or no, I ſhall now examine, yet without the leaſt intention to reflect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Chymical Way in general, or any Learned and Candid Profeſſor thereof.</p>
            <p>He ſays (<hi>P.</hi> 158.) <hi>That till within this ten or a dozen years this Noble Science bath undergone much ignominy.</hi> — I have reckoned up a number of Authors who have writ in Commendation of it, and mentioned ſeveral in theſe our own dayes and Nation, who are Fautors of it; and therefore I judge there is no cauſe for this complaint. But if it has ſuſtained any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy, it has proceeded either from the ignorance of ſuch as were pretenders to it, but did not prepare their Medicines aright, or elſe from thoſe that uſe them prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p>I grant that this <hi>Noble Art</hi> (which doubtleſs is more proper than to call it a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99554:115"/>Science) has got more reputation of late than formerly, and I wiſh it may never loſe it again by the folly of its Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <p>(<hi>P.</hi> 159.) <hi>We ſee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that in all Concretes whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral, there is a mixture of pure and impure, of groſs and tenuious parts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet as to medicinal uſe, its the pure, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſpirituous parts of Vegetables or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, or the depurated fixt part, or the re-union of both after purification, which aſſiſts Nature againſt the Malady.</hi> — Firſt,<note place="margin">Groſs parts not unfit for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</note> I do not think that the groſs parts are always impure, and the thin parts pure, but that even the groſs parts may be as pure as the thin (and in ſome drugs are more uſeful than the thin.) Thus Water and Earth though they be more groſs, yet are as pure Elements as Fire and Air, and equally joyned with them in the Compoſition of mixed Bodies. Had God Almighty made Man meerly a ſpiritual ſubſtance, I ſhould have thought that he had been beſt fed and phyſickt with pure ſpirituous parts and quinteſſences; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo a groſs Body, and a capacious
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99554:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>Stomach and Bowels, fitted to receive groſs parts and furniſht with Concoctive Faculties, whereby the Vertue of them for Diet or Phyſick are commodiouſly drawn out, I think the groſs parts were as well let alone, and not taken from the thin parts, only a little fitted for Natures more eaſie extraction, as we uſe to do by Fire.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee our Bodies are well nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with Fleſh, and Corn, and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables in their groſs Bodies, whereas the Chymical Extracts, and Spirits or Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſences of theſe, would ſoon feed a Man to death: And the like reaſon there is for Phyſick, wherein the groſs parts are ſometimes to be preferred far before their Spirits. <hi>Rubarb</hi> is an excellent Purge for Choler, and alſo aſtrictive, the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit or Oil not ſo. Thus <hi>Pepper</hi> groſly beaten is better againſt Wind, and alſo the Decoction of Aniſe ſeeds, than their Chymical Spirits, by the conſent of many Learned Writers.</p>

Thus <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Monavius</hi> cited by <hi>Scholtzius</hi> (Ep. 163. (who was himſelf a great friend to Chymiſtry) taxes the Pſeudochymiſts for ſpoiling many good Medicines in extracting their Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences (too long here to recite) and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerning the making of their <hi>Magiſtery of Pearl,</hi> or extracting its Spirits with <hi>Acetum Radicatum;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole ſubſtance of the Pearl is corrupted, and becomes corroſive. And he tells of one <hi>Caſparus Logus,</hi> who by taking this Magiſtery from a <hi>Paracelſian</hi> died, and being opened, the Tunicles of his Stomach were found black and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: and the like he ſays happened to a <hi>Marqueſs his Lady,</hi> whoſe Stomach was eaten through with the poyſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And yet this we know is an excellent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99554:116"/>Cordial as its uſed by the Galeniſts in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>And of the ſame mind is the ingenious Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in ſeveral places of his <hi>Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chymiſt,</hi> as alſo in many other places of his Writings, particularly in his <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſophy</hi> (2 Part. cap. 6. p. 148.) <hi>Methinks</hi> (ſays he) <hi>thoſe that practice as if Nature preſented us nothing worth the accepting, unleſs it be cooked and perfected by</hi> Vulcan, <hi>might conſider that</hi> Paracelſus <hi>himſelf oftentimes imployeth Simples for the cure even of formidable Diſeaſes.</hi> Beſides the ſucceſs that we have in the uſe of Conſerves, Condites, Powders, and Compoſitions, made of theſe might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any rational perſon, which is done with much more ſafety and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, than with Spirits and Chymical Oyls.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will have theſe Spirits and <hi>purer parts</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>to be re-united after ſeparation, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Vehicles;</hi> I think their own parts are the moſt proper Vehicles they can be joyned to, as being connatural to them, (I ſpeak of Vegetables.) Indeed as for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99554:117"/>Minerals and Metals, which are moſt what virulent and venemous, or elſe whoſe groſsneſs renders them indomita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and uneaſie to Nature to extract their Vertues, doubtleſs a ſeparation of their uſeful and thin parts by Fire or Salts, is of great uſe in them, and not at all to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>

            <p>(<hi>P.</hi> 167.) He undertakes to anſwer the Objections which are made againſt this Art by the Galeniſts. — Why!

But I pray is not this bravely confirmed, from a little intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99554:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heat or Feveriſhneſs (as he calls it) which was meerly lymptomatical from pain, and that a Cold Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Wind, to argue therefore it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a violent Fever? — If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> catch a Fever in earneſt, and manage it according to his preſent Opinion, I'l tell him his fortune; he will become <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and forfeit his Goods and Chattels to the King.</p>
            <p>I can tell where one that vaunts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chymiſt, came to a Phyſitian at <hi>Malton,</hi> who was himſelf alſo Chymiſt enough, and in a Fever (which before that ſeemed to be in its Declination) gave him a Doſe of this <hi>Elixir,</hi> and ſome <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoretick Pills,</hi> as he called them; which immediately inflamed the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo as that his neareſt relations at this day ſay, that it appeared to him, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the taking of them (to uſe his own expreſſion) as if his Eyes would have ſtarted out; which the Gentleman feeling, cried out while he had life of the acrimonious heat of the Medicines, and declared that if he recovered that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he would leave that pernicious way
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99554:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>of preſcribing, and fall into a more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Practice. But alas! a day or two ended his life, leaving his Friend to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>(P. 178.) He ſays, <hi>That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chymical Remedies are accuſed to be ſmelling too much of the Fire, yet the Fire is no leſs uſeful for the preparing of Medicines, then for the Cooking of Meats.</hi> — What's this to the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which reſpects the Empyreuma, or Corroſive Quality; or Nidorous Taſte, which they draw from the Fire, ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times more of the Fire, than of the Simple out of which they are made; whereby they inflame the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Inteſtines of the Patients? For ſuch violent Heat of the Fire produces that out of the Simple, which was not in it before (even like a Man upon the Rack, whoſe torment makes him oft times ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which was never in his heart) and this it doth according as the Simple is capable of enduring the Fire. But it is not onely the Mineral Medicines which Patients complain of in this Point of Heat, but alſo the ordinary way which ſome
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99554:122"/>Chymiſts uſe in preſcribing other ſharp and hot Medicines. However what force of Argument is there here, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the uſe of Fire in Cooking of Meats, which we ſee makes them more eaſie to be concocted, while yet they contract no Empyreuma, or Nidorous Heat? The Galeniſts ſpeak not againſt the uſe of Fire, either for the preparing of Meats or Medicines, but uſe it as much as is needful in them both. But I can tell of ſome whom he calls Galeniſts, that have too much cauſe to find fault with ſome mens hot Medicines; whereof Patients make oft ſad complaints, calling for their help to correct the corroding heat, which they find from ſome Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Practice.</p>
            <p>O you my Learned and Worthy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of this City of <hi>York,</hi> you are my Witneſſes, How often have all of you and I, both joyntly and ſeverally, heard the ſad complaints of many in this poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But at length I ſuſpect this man will challenge Cookery to be a point of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, and ſo forbid the Galeniſts to eat or drink any thing that is wholſome. It appears indeed if it were in ſome mens power, they would ſoon tie up our Chaps.</p>

            <p> For as I had occaſion to obſerve before,<note place="margin">Note.</note> it is much to be ſuſpected, that their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which are out of ſuch virulent, corroding, and oft times poyſonous Drugs, as he has here confeſſed, being given in ſubſtance, by lying in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides of the Stomach, and cleaving to the Bowels, may from the contact of the Acid Humors of the Body, reſume their Ancient Arſenical Properties, as <hi>Zwelfer</hi> ſays concerning <hi>Antimonium Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoreticum.</hi> And the ſame Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms concerning Vitriol calcined, even till it has depoſited all its ſharpneſs, that yet being expoſed to the Air, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an Acrimonious Salt. (in <hi>Pharm. Aug. p.</hi> 675) And may there not be as good reaſon to ſuſpect it from the Acid Humors in the Body, as from the Air? Now this is plainly apparent to every mans eye, that that which has depoſited its malignity, may yet from the Air take it up again. Suppoſe a piece of very ſtrong Tobacco dried in the Pocket, till it has loſt all its ſtrength; lay but this in the Window when the Air is moiſt, and it ſhall become as ſtrong as before, and

            <p>(<hi>P.</hi> 183.) <hi>A ſtrong Fire is as requiſite in ſome Mineral Preparations, as a mild Fire to ſome eaſie Vegetable Separations,</hi> &amp;c.— Why! the Queſtion in difference is not, whether a ſtrong Fire be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Mineral Preparations, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral Preparations be neceſſary in Phyſick. If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> loſes his Queſtion, he gives up his Cauſe. Certainly the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica</hi> was full enough to anſwer all Indications in Phyſick, before this new proceſs by Chymical Medicines was found out; and the Ancients yea the Modern Phyſicians that wave them, cure Diſeaſes as well, if not better, than the Chymiſts can with their Medicines alone, without the other.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> goes on and ſays, <hi>Would not a Cook Maid be accuſed of ignorance, if ſhe intending to roaſt a piece of Meat, ſhould lay it down at a diſproportionate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Fire?</hi>— and then he tells how roaſting of Meat is performed. — A piece of good Chymiſtry indeed, and of general uſe; I could wiſh they would

            <p>And yet great care muſt be had that this Medicine be opportunely preſcribed, and in a due Doſe (as indeed it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in others) and therefore not to be meddled withal by every good Wife or temerarious Quack. <hi>Sennertus</hi> tells (<hi>de Conſenſ.

            <p>Nor is it the curing of a Diſeaſe, <hi>Cito, tuto, &amp; facile,</hi> that implies a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> doth ſuppoſe; that may be done by a Woman who knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Method, nor how to anſwer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99554:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is the Rule of Method. To make a man a Methodical Phyſician, there muſt be a good Foundation laid in <hi>Phyſiology</hi> and <hi>Pathology;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.</note> the former takes in <hi>Anatomy,</hi> which treats concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Compoſition of a Mans Body, which is the proper Subject of the Art of Phyſick, and the Contexture of the parts, as they refer one to another; whereby an Artiſt is enabled to diſcern of Diſeaſes that come from Sympathy and Conſent of other Parts, and ſo to apply his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies accordingly. It reſpects alſo the Temperaments, the Humors, the Spirits, the Faculties of the Soul, and the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Vital,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Functions, with many other things that are <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> to theſe.<note place="margin">Of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology.</note> 
               <hi>Pathology</hi> treats concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes, with their Differences, their Cauſes, their Symptomes, and their Signs; and comprehends thoſe that are both univerſal and particular, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward or outward: inabling an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt both to judge aright of the Diſeaſes, and alſo make true <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>

            <p>Nevertheleſs as to this Query I'l tell him my Opinion, yet not as the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Galeniſts, I leave every man to abound in his own ſenſe. I take <hi>Antimony</hi> out of which the <hi>Stibium</hi> and <hi>Crocus</hi> are made by Calcination, to have in it an <hi>Arſenical</hi> poyſonous or malignant property, which diſcovers it ſelf if it be unlockt by Fire, otherwiſe it's innocent,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99554:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>(as alſo ſeveral other of the Minerals and Metals) and to be abhorrent to Nature, but being calcined with Salts, it loſes much of its Venome or Malignity, while yet it retains ſome property which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile to the Stomach. Now the liquor wherein theſe are infuſed after Calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, imbibing the Odor and Vapor of the <hi>Antimony</hi> becomes troubleſome to the Stomach, by which Nature is rouſed up to expel it; and ſo caſts out the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and the bad Humors together both upward and downward, as it beſt can get paſſage, and by its poſition enclines. Thus the vomiting and purging are not ſo much the proper effect of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, as of the Natural Faculties of the Stomach and Bowels (by the Chymiſts called <hi>Archaeus</hi>) imitated by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which is performed by the help of the tranſverſe Fibres in the parts.</p>
            <p>And of theſe two I take the <hi>Crocus</hi> to be the better, which is prepared with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;</hi> now this Calcination being ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to wit, but a blaze, does not take away the <hi>Toxical</hi> property of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> but leaves enough to hold up its
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99554:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>hoſtility to Nature, and ſo to expel it through the Body.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner out of other of the Minerals, which are not ſo ſafe to be given inwardly in ſubſtance without ſome correction, are <hi>Emeticks</hi> made: as out of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is made the <hi>Sal Vitrioli,</hi> ſo highly extolled by <hi>Angelus Sala,</hi> with Calcination, Dilution, and frequent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulcoration.

            <p> Now the Vomiting quality having been ſo cloſely united to the <hi>Arſenical,</hi> and but newly ſeparated there-from, I think the <hi>Stibium</hi> and the <hi>Crocus</hi> are much ſafer to be given in the <hi>Infuſion,</hi> than in ſubſtance; becauſe given in their groſs powder, there might be danger leſt ſticking to the Tunicles of the Stomach, they ſhould bring on an <hi>Hypercatharſis,</hi> or too violent motions in vomiting and purging, not eaſie to be ſtaid, to the hazard of the Patients life, as I have ſometimes obſerved in the hands of Quacks; as alſo the danger there may be of reſuming their former malignity from the Acid Humors of the Stomach.</p>
            <p>And there is the like danger of the <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> even of that which is the very beſt of thoſe that are made out of Minerals and Metals, and in moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe (to wit) the <hi>Antimonium Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum,</hi> as I hinted before out of the ingenious <hi>Zwelfer,</hi> even from the Air it ſelf, and more may it be doubted from the Acide Ferment that is within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Mant.

            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> goes on and ſays, <hi>Since the true cauſe of the Operation of Medicines, and the knowledge we have of them, is taken from and grounded upon Experiments, and theſe Experiments are as likely to fall into the obſervation of thoſe who are ignorant of a Method, as of thoſe that are skilful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; what advantage then hath a Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt, whoſe grounds and principles are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found unſucceſsful in practice, or much what contradicted by experience?</hi> — Here he begs the Queſtion, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines that the Methodiſts are unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their Practice; and perhaps ſome may be ſo, or any man in ſome thing: for as I have already ſaid we are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but are in a poſſibility to erre; though there is a great probability we ſhall not, if we duly weigh the Rules of our Art, and the ſtate of the Patient. However he that underſtands the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Method, ſhall probably be ſucceſsful, when the <hi>Ignoramus</hi> knows not what to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99554:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>do. But further I perceive Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his aim is wholly directed to the operation of the Medicine, and what it will do, when certainly the Nature of the Diſeaſe and Conſtitution of the Patient, are as ſeriouſly to be reſpected as the Medicine; and then the Indications put the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to ſeek out a proper Remedy, leſt <hi>Andabatarum more,</hi> he encounter blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with Diſeaſes. And if a Phyſician go out thus fitted, his knowledge is well grounded, eſpecially if he be backed with former experiences of parallel Caſes, as a well practiſed and obſerving Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an poſſibly may: And thus his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not conjectural but certain, in reſpect of the operation of his Medicine, for though the firſt finding out of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Medicine was by chance, yet he is become certain of it, and his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is rational.</p>

               <hi>Concerning</hi> The Original of Springs.</head>
            <p>I Am now come to this Appendix concerning the Original of Springs, where he deſigns to confute what I have ſaid in my Book of <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw</hi> concerning that Subject, wherein I have examined the variety of Opinions among both Ancient and Modern Philoſophers: ſome aſcribing it to the Sea, the Water whereof they will have conveyed by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Channels to all the Springs at Land; and to that purpoſe they fancy the Sea to be higher than the Land, and conſequently the Water to run <hi>per-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clive</hi> in a Natural Motion, to any, even the higheſt Springs at Land. This I have
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99554:160"/>examined, and according to my Model have proved to be but a fancy, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arguments, from <hi>Page</hi> 55 to <hi>Page</hi> 76 of my Book of <hi>Scarbrough-Spaw,</hi> (<hi>Edition</hi> 2.) too long here to be recited. But others that are for the Sea to be the Original of Springs, being with me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the former fancy of the Seas altitude above the Land, have their various opinions concerning the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Water from the Sea to the Springs, as there I inſtance out of their Authors; the diſagreement of whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, may well ſave me the labour of refutation.</p>
            <p>Others there are that will have the Water conveyed from the Sea into ſome large Caverns that are in the Earth, and there by heat from Subterraneal Fires kindled by <hi>Naphtha</hi> and <hi>Bitumen,</hi> will have Water reſolved into Vapors, which aſcending towards the Superficies of the Earth, are by a more remiſſe degree of heat condenſed again into Water, and ſo make the Springs; which was the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> as alſo <hi>Seneca,</hi> to which <hi>Eall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:99554:160"/>and Dr. <hi>French</hi> adhere. This I have weighed according to my Cubit, and find it of no weight, from <hi>Page</hi> 77. to <hi>P.</hi> 89.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Opinion concerning the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Springs, is that of <hi>Seneca</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Nat. Queſt. cap.</hi> 7.) <hi>zid.</hi> by a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Earth into Water in the Caverns of the Earth; which ſince I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it has not many Fautors, I waved as not needing Confutation: and ſo came to that of <hi>Ariſtotle, vid.</hi> that the Springs are generated from the tranſmutation of Air into Water in the Subterraneal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns. This alſo I conſidered of and found invalid; from <hi>P.</hi> 89. to 93. being attended with inextricable difficulties and abſurdities.</p>
            <p>I then proceeded to conſider of Rain and Snow being the Cauſe of the Springs, of which Opinion I found <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magrus</hi> and <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> to have been the moſt eminent Patrons, and to them I did with modeſty joyn in my judgement. I have lately heard that <hi>Leſſius</hi> has writ ſomething upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and alſo that learned Frenchman
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99554:161"/>
               <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> has newly ſet forth a peculiar Tractate in defence of it; but it has not been my hap as yet to meet with either of them.</p>
            <p>What grounds <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Agricola</hi> had laid down for their aſſerting this Opinion I declared, together with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objections againſt them made by learned men, who ſince have treated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject. To theſe I replied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my talent, having not preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the mention of any Argument, that ſeemed to have any thing of weight or reaſon in it, that ever I had met with in any Ancient or Modern Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Opinion; which as I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in anſwer to them, I backed with new Arguments of Demonſtration of my own, grounded on Reaſon and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, both of my own and others, in our own Nation or abroad (from <hi>Pag.</hi> 93. to 110.) modeſtly ſubmitting all to the judgement of the more learned and conſiderate. And truly I have had thanks from ſeveral very learned Gentlemen for that Diſcourſe, who declared themſelves to have become
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99554:161"/>Proſelytes to the Opinion upon my grounds.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> it appears, is not ſatisfied, and gives ſome Reaſons againſt it, which being for their Subſtance no other, then what I have there mentioned to be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by others, and have alſo replied to, (though he takes no notice of it) I judge needleſs to repeat here, but do rather refer both him and the Reader to what I have ſaid there, this being ſwelled into a bigger Volume already than at firſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Indeed he has a diſtinction of <hi>Land-Springs</hi> and <hi>Quick-Springs</hi> mentioned <hi>P.</hi> 286. which runs through all he has to ſay againſt the Opinion, granting that <hi>Land-Springs</hi> may proceed from Rain and Snow, but denying it as to the <hi>Quick Springs,</hi> and yielding that the failing of Rain and Snow may be the cauſe of the drying up of the former, but not of the latter. — But is not this plainly the begging of the Queſtion, while I have proved that there is no real difference in this diſtinction, but that they are both one, both in their Cauſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:99554:162"/>and in the Quality of the Water? and that where there is never any Rain or Snow, as in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ombrion,</hi> there are no Springs; where there is little Rain, there are few Springs as in <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> in ſo much as for many miles together there is not a Spring to be found (as Travailers tell us) to quench their thirſt or their Camels. And in Countries where there uſes to be great plenty of Rain, there are great plenty of Springs; yet if for ſome good ſpace of time there be a failure of them, moſt of the Springs that ordinarily were not wont to fail, do dry up, as it happened in this Kingdome in the years 1654, 55, and 56: And when there is a total fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure for many years together, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> for 36 years together, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Coſmography; there they are wholly dried up, as there it fell out, ſo as the Inhabitants were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave the place, and ſeek for a new Habitation elſewhere for want of Water.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:99554:162"/>
            <p> Beſides are not all ſorts of Springs at Land, and ſo to be called <hi>Land-Springs?</hi> I ſee no difference ſave only in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, and I have ſufficiently proved <hi>that</hi> to depend upon the Continuation of Rain and Snow, while being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn in any proportion, the Springs fail accordingly, even ſuch as all men thought to have been <hi>Perennes,</hi> or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; which are thoſe that he calls <hi>Quick-Springs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed as to that of the three dry years 1654, 55, 56, during which ſpace we had very little Rain or Snow in <hi>York ſhire,</hi> either in Winter or Summer, when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved very many of our Springs upon the high Wolds were dried up, which in the memory of man had never failed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo as they were forc'd to drive their Cattle many miles for Water: <hi>This</hi> (he ſays) <hi>he enquired of the Countrey people, and they teſtified it was not ſo.</hi> To this I anſwer, it is matter of fact, of which I was an Eye-witneſs, and I doubt not but my Affirmative will find Credit with the Ingenuous Men of the World, before thoſe Countrey peoples negative, who
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99554:163"/>either might live in Low-grounds where the failing of the Springs was not ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or poſſibly after ſo many years they may have forgotten.</p>
            <p>But this I took the more notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a Confirmation to me of this Opinion of the Original of Springs, with which I did abound ever ſince I was at the Univerſity, and conſidered that Point of Philoſophy. All that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> replies to it (<hi>P.</hi> 291.) is, that thoſe Springs that did ſo dry up, were not <hi>Perennes,</hi> or everlaſting, or ſuch as he calls Quick-Springs. Why! I ſay ſo too, and that indeed there are no Springs ſo <hi>Perennes,</hi> but from the deficiency of Rain they will be dried up; and many of thoſe were ſuch as in all the Story of the Wolds ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed before: and thoſe that did yet flow, were ſo ſlow in their Streams, as that the neareſt Inhabitants began to be very ſcrupulous to ſupply their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, for fear they ſhould lack for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But further, to return to my Argument I draw from Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Story of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> I would know from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99554:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>there were in <hi>Cyprus</hi> theſe two ſorts of Springs according to his diſtinction or no? If not, then it was only the Quick-Springs that were awanting, and why ſhould <hi>Cyprus</hi> alone be defective in ſuch a neceſſary thing? If they were both there, then the Quick-Springs failed as well as the other, and ſo his diſtinction is invalid; the reaſon of all is, that they all came from the ſame Cauſe (to wit) the Rain, which failing totally for many years together, they were dried up; ſo as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows that the Quick-Springs at <hi>Cyprus</hi> came from the Rain, and the like we may judge of all the Springs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> finding himſelf pinched with this Argument, has a very ready An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, even almoſt the ſame that the Countrey-Parſon uſed in the Pulpit in Confutation of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>Bellarmine thou lieſt.</hi> — For he calls in Queſtion the Honour and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Reverend Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> ſaying (<hi>P.</hi> 301.) <hi>That like as Hiſtorians uſe to do, he might probably take it upon truſt.</hi> And becauſe he knows not how to evade the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:99554:164"/>force of the Argument, he denies the verity of the matter of fact, and cries out in theſe words, — <hi>That an I ſland ſo near the Mediterranean Sea ſhould want Rain, for</hi> 36 <hi>years together, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put an ordinary credulity upon the Tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, and ſtretch a</hi> Thomas <hi>beyond his ordinary pitch.</hi> And thus Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has turned over his thumb two of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the three dry years mentioned laſt, and this of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> by denying the verity of the matters of fact; an eaſie way of Anſwer indeed.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Doctor Heylin,</hi> he did certainly take it upon truſt, and ſo did Mr. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> in his Pilgrimage (<hi>Page</hi> 439.) and Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> in his Travails (<hi>Edit.</hi> 3. <hi>P.</hi> 222.) who relate the ſame Story. And I pray what other means of knowledge have we of matters of fact done before our Times, but to take them upon truſt of thoſe that commit them down to us? And ſo I find did <hi>Doctor Heylin</hi> and the reſt, for they have the ſubſtance of it (I gueſs) from <hi>Mattheaus Quadus</hi> his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciculus Geographiae,</hi> and he ſeems to ſetch it from <hi>Boterus</hi> (whom as yet I cannot
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:99554:164"/>meet withal) <hi>Quadus</hi> his words are, <hi>Boterus iſtuc addit, Conſtantini Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris tempore, continuis ſeptemdecim annis, nullae hic fuere pluviae, unde deſerta manſit Inſula, donee D. Helenae beneficio in Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po Monte Templum aedificaretur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde pluviae redierant, ac habitari denuo caepit.</hi> To wit, <hi>Boterus</hi> adds this, that about the time of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> for 17 years together here was no Rain at all, ſo as the Iſland was forſaken by the Inhabitants, till the time that <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> the Empreſs built a Church in Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> &amp;c. about which time the Rain returned, and it began again to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> and <hi>Doctor Heylin</hi> do agree in their mention of the number of 36 years, but out of whom they had it, I diſcern not, for they cite not their Author. But its all one to my purpoſe, the failure of the Rain made the Iſland unhabitable for want of Water in their Rivers and Springs, and conſequently, the Rain was the Proximal Cauſe of them.</p>
            <p>I have other Arguments wherewith I did confirm this Opinion in my Book:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99554:165"/>As concerning one of the Fortunate Iſlands or Canaries called <hi>Ombrion,</hi> now <hi>Fierre,</hi> which I mention <hi>P.</hi> 98. of my Book, where it never rains, but the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are ſupplied with Water by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Providence of God, from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tree that grows there plentifully, which diſtills from its leaves every Night an abundance of Water, enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Inhabitants and their Cattle with Water. <hi>Ovetanus</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> do both ſay there are no Springs in the Iſland, nor Rivers. <hi>But to this Mr.</hi> S. <hi>gives no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when (<hi>P.</hi> 118.) I deduce an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the full and perfect Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is in all Qualities perceptible to the Senſes betwixt Rain and Spring-Water, ſo as its hard to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
            <p>And when I mention there another from the exact Identity of the Water of thoſe he calls <hi>Quick-Springs,</hi> and of that which flows out of the other, which he calls <hi>Land-Springs;</hi> and grants that they proceed wholly from Rain and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99554:165"/>Snow; which if they proceeded from ſeveral Cauſes, muſt probably differ in ſome reſpect: <hi>He leaps over it;</hi> will you ☜ know the reaſon? even becauſe he could not anſwer it. And yet ſo diſ-ingenuous is he (P. 301.) as to ſay, <hi>That he had run through all that I had offered in order to the confirming of this opinion of Rain and Snow to be the Original of Springs, and probably if not demonſtratively overturned the Opinion, together with my grounds, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reaſons.</hi> It's apparent to many that have read his Book, that he had a wrathful deſign againſt me, which all along he has proſecuted with as much rancour as poſſibly he could, aiming at victory rather than verity, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this Diſpute about the Springs, while he has not the leaſt ground of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that he has anſwered my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein the force of the Opinion laid. Certainly no man that ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Learning or Reputation writ at this rate.</p>
            <p>But while I was anſwering an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s which he made againſt this Original, I made a Conceſſion that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99554:166"/>there may be ſome tranſmutation of Air into Water in the Earth or above, from whence it comes that Churches become wet before Rain falls: I find Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſevere againſt me, <hi>I wonder</hi> (ſays he <hi>P.</hi> 299.) <hi>the Doctors Philoſophy in his Second Edition ſhould not come out more maturate than to adhere to this old and long ſince exploded tranſmutability of Elementss.</hi> In ſo much that he ſeems willing to hang the point in controverſie upon that hinge. <hi>So ſure</hi> (ſays he <hi>as the Aire is tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Water,</hi> which moiſtens the Stone Walls of Buildings, ſo ſure is the Air in the Bowels of the Earth tranſmuted into Water, yea and ſo ſure is the Original of Fountains from Rain and Snow Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. — Well! Let the cauſe go upon that, I deſire no more, and then I am aſſured the learnedeſt men of the World will be of my Opinion about the Original of Springs.</p>
            <p>Is not that Air which we breath in, and that Water which we drink under that Notion? Now its plain that ſome of that Air that we breath in (within a Church) will in a few hours be turned
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99554:166"/>into Water upon the Walls and Floors before Rain, which being collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether may be drunk into the Stomach, and quench thirſt. I know where it pinches Mr. <hi>S.</hi> I do not take this Air and Water to be pure Elements, for ſo we could not live in them; its enough that they are ſuch as all the World c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Term uſed by himſelf in ſeveral places of this his Appendix about Springs, but he will not allow me to call it ſo. If this be not properly called <hi>Air,</hi> I do not know where we ſhall find it in the World, nor will Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ever be able to deſcribe its <hi>ubi</hi> by Ocular Demonſtration, nor yet <hi>Helmont</hi> whom he follows; For my own part I chuſe rather to retain the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Grounds and Terms of Philoſophy now uſed for many Ages, than to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the new way of Canting in frothy words, much in uſe among ſome late Writers, eſpecially ſuch as go this way; who while they have no new matter, do yet coyn new terms to obſcure truth, on purpoſe to amuſe ignorant Readers, as if themſelves had been Inventors.</p>
            <p>If what now I have ſaid be ſufficient in the judgement of wiſe and learned men, to evince a poſſibility of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of <hi>Air</hi> into Water, then I need ſay no more as to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in the proof of the Point in hand, concerning the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99554:169"/>of Springs from Rain and Snow. Nor has he any way to evade it, but by calling in Queſtion the Credit of the Relators in matter of Fact, as he does with Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> And I muſt confeſs, were it not for the Credit of the Relator, and his plain and undeniable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of evidence whereby he makes it out, a man would very much doubt of the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the laſt. But without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Perſon of that Honour, Prudence, and Learning, would take care that he might not be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>As for the former Story of <hi>Cardane</hi> and <hi>Fromundus</hi> which is alſo rare, there is leſs ground of admiration, ſince ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary (not much different) has been obſerved among our ſelves. I my ſelf knew a Sergeant belonging to the Garriſon at <hi>Hull,</hi> who in a <hi>Diabete</hi> did void above 6 Quarts (to wit) about 12 Pounds of Urine every 24 hours, for ſome weeks together, till all his muſculous parts were diſſolved into Urine (and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Skeleton) the meaſure whereof did far exceed the weight of his whole Body, and of his Meat and Drink, while yet he drank not 3 Pints of Drink in a day. But</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:99554:169"/>
            <p> But (<hi>P.</hi> 296.) Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tell us, <hi>He meets with two great difficulties which he cannot get through, the ſolving of which</hi> (he ſays) <hi>will prove ominous to my Theſis: The firſt is, how the Rain Water ſhall ſink into the Earth by empty Crevices or Clefts, and what is that which muſt bring the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate particles of Water, which fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Crevice or Cleft and another into the distant Crevices?</hi> — Why where is the difficulty? Water is thin in ſubſtance and alſo a heavy body, and he grants the Crevices or Clefts are <hi>empty,</hi> what then ſhould hinder its ſinking? Nothing in the World is more plain than that it does ſo. But it ſeems by what he ſays (<hi>P.</hi> 297) that he would have been pleaſed if I had otherwiſe expreſſed it; <hi>Suppoſing the Earth to imbibe Rain Water as a Sponge, where it meeting with capillary Veins or ſmall Pores, not Clefts or Crevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which</hi> (he ſays) <hi>are ſcarce to be found but among Rocks, ſinks down by degrees into larger Veins, and thoſe into Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneal Channels, where it makes Springs; and this he acknowledges would have been truly ſaid.</hi> — Well if this be true in his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99554:170"/>Judgement, then Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has given up his cauſe, while he is ſtarting a difficulty. Only his diſtinction of <hi>Land-Springs</hi> and <hi>Quick-Springs</hi> ſaves him, for he grants the former, but is not ſatisfied in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I wonder Mr <hi>S.</hi> ſhould obſerve no better what he is doing, than to taxe me for not ſaying ſo, when in effect he ſays nothing but my own words in the 94th Page of my Book; where treating of the Sinking of Rain and Snow Water into the Earth, I expreſs it thus, — It finks down by ſecret paſſages into the Earth, with which the Superficies doth abound (which are like unto the ſmall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of Veins not diſcernable by the Eye, terminating in the Skin in all the parts of our Bodies) and in rocky ground it ſinks through the Clefts, and by them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Subterraneal Channels more or leſs deep in the Earth, where it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by the Earth, and moves as Blood in the Veins.</p>
            <p>Now this I having ſaid, and he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be truly ſaid, the difficulty is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and it becomes an Argument of demonſtration for the proof of my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99554:170"/>I wonder either at his diſ-inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in denying me to have ſaid ſo, or at his inadvertency in not obſerving that, which in his own Opinion has ſo much of truth in it, and is ſo materi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l to the point in controverſie. But this proceeds (I ſuppoſe) from his Combination with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this Work, while one takes one piece in hand, and a ſecond another, and in the mean time he that undertook to make his inferences, did not well diſcern the ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The next difficulty which <hi>Pag.</hi> 297.) (he ſays) is moſt conſiderable, is, <hi>How the Rain Water ſinking into the Earth ſhould ſupply the Springs that are in Hills or high Heaths?</hi> — To this I reply, That as 'tis very r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Springs upon the tops of Hills, ſo where ever they are, they are very penurious Springs, affording but little Water, and break out ordinarily upon the dependant ſides of the Hills, which they may very well receive from the Rain and Snow that falls above them, upon the tops of the Hills, which may ſettle to that dependant part; theſe not ſuffering
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99554:171"/>ſuch expence of Water from Men or Beaſts, and being ſupplied by every Shower, and not ſo much ſcorched by the heat of the Sun, as lower grounds are, may very well be ſuppoſed to be ſo cauſed and perpetuated. Beſides that Hills are uſually even in the dryeſt ſeaſons kept moiſt by Clouds and Miſts that do encompaſs them, as upon my own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I can ſpeak of ſome Hills that have Springs in them. And if it be thus with thoſe Springs that break out upon the Hills, much more plain is it in them that break out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaths, where the ground being level, they receive the Rain and Snow more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, and afford Springs accordingly.</p>
            <p>Beſides we ſee that Water is of it ſelf apt to motion, for being poured out, it doth immediately ſpread it ſelf (which it is well fitted to do by reaſon of its fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and much more it is prone to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Bowels of the Earth, where it loſes much of its gravity, being out of its proper place, aſſigned to it by the Creator; <hi>viz.</hi> the Convex part of the Earth to which it has a natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tendency, not reſting till it meets
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:99554:171"/>with its natural Correſpondent the Air, under which it muſt needs lie, by reaſon of its greater gravity, as above the Earth, by reaſon of its levity, Hence it is (as I conceive) that it ceaſes not to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Superficies of the Earth, ſo long as the Channels have a ſupply of Water; nor is there any difference of ſite to it, as to up or down, while it is in its Channels (like the Blood in the Veins of our Bodies) but it breaks out where ever it finds vent, and ſo makes Springs; and that ſo forcibly too, as that it brings out with it the <hi>Sabulum</hi> or Sand, which is a far heavier body than it ſelf: from whence we ſee that the bottoms of Rivers are covered with it.</p>
            <p>And this agrees with what <hi>Helmont</hi> ſays <hi>P.</hi> 47. in contemplation whereof he ſeems to be rapt up into an admiration, and breaks forth into a high <hi>Doxology. Aqua</hi> (inquit) <hi>intra vividum terrae fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſorbetur, &amp; trahitur, unde commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem nacta vitam (Regem cui omnia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt, venite adoremus!) lecorum ſitus neſcit, cacumina montium ſine moleſtia facile adſcendit, una cum Quellem, ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſinentes

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:99554:172"/>Level of Plains; yea it can as well mount tops of Hills and high Heaths, as the Blood in the Arteries can aſcend into the Head; and all this</hi> (ſaith he <hi>by the Natural Circulation of Water, ſet on work by the Original</hi> Fiat.— So that upon the whole matter we ſee Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is not invincible in his Objections, nor yet ſo fully reſolved in this point, but that he can change his mind upon a ſleight cauſe, and even as his intereſt carries him aſſert Contradictions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to examine what he has to ſay concerning the Eſtabliſhing of another Original of Springs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as in all things elſe that he has treated of) I find him very Poſitive; for ſo in (<hi>P.</hi> 303.) he calls it a <hi>new and poſitive Theſis; and that is from a Circulation of Water in the Terraqueous Globe, by the mediation of Subterraneal Channels along the</hi> Sabulum Bulliens, <hi>from the Sea to the Heads of Springs, and from them into Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, and thence into Rivers, and ſo back again into the Ocean;</hi> thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sea to be the Original of Springs. — Thus far it is no new Theſis, but as old as <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and is followed
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99554:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>by <hi>Valeſius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lydiat,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carpenter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> and Dr. <hi>French.</hi> What Reaſons they have propounded in their Writings to perſwade them to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I have examined in my Book of the <hi>Spaw</hi> from <hi>P.</hi> 55. to 89. but could not receive ſatisfaction from them on the grounds I there laid down; beſides the great diſagreement among themſelves in ſeeking out a paſſage to the Springs.</p>
            <p>And for the making out of this Poſitive Theſis, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> in <hi>Pag.</hi> 317. which certainly is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foundation in the Judgement of wiſe and rational men; <hi>viz. He ſuppoſes, That the Seas are perforated at the bottom in many places, with Subterraneal Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and ſecret Vortices, through which the Water of the Sea finds paſſage; into certain</hi> Hydrophylacia <hi>or common Ciſterns of Water; where it comes to a Level with the Surface of the Sea; and from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Atmoſphere of the Air, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Winds, Clouds, and Storms, and the oblique Motion of the Tides upon the Surface of the Sea, the Water is forced up from thoſe Ciſterns even to the highest Hills or Plains, and ſo makes Springs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:99554:173"/>
            <p> Here is much ſaid, but nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Indeed a Grand <hi>Suppoſition</hi> (for ſo he calls it) which he ought neceſſarily to have proved, before he had given his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence againſt my Theſis, leſt he be to ſeek for a true Original of his Springs. And yet to ſpeak out, <hi>neither is this his own,</hi> but wholly borrowed from <hi>Kircherus de Origine Fontium</hi> in his <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Subterraneus,</hi> where he diſcourſes at large upon this Subject, making no leſs than five Suppoſitions, in order to his Deſign of illuſtrating the Sea to be the Original of Springs, although he differs from others about the manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; which with ſubmiſſion to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgements) ſeem to me to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the begging of the Queſtion; affording very little ſatisfaction to any man that ſhall well ſtudy the Point.</p>
            <p>But to return to Mr. S. <hi>He ſuppoſes that the Seas are perforated at the bottom, or to have holes through which the Water runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Subterraneal Channels</hi> (or as <hi>Kircherus</hi> calls them <hi>Rivers,</hi> which he fancies to be far larger than thoſe we have above the Barth.) — But how knows he this to be
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99554:174"/>ſo, ſince no man ever ſaw them? <hi>De non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio,</hi> is a good Rule in Reaſon. I cannot believe there are ſuch holes, becauſe they do not appear to the eye of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Norfolk Waſhes,</hi> where at every Low Water or Ebbe of the Sea, the Water goes out, and leaves the Land bare for many miles together, no ſuch holes were ever ſeen; nor on the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Seas are very ſhallow at Low Water for ſome leagues together, is there the leaſt Symbole of theſe holes, which probably ſhould be if any ſuch thing were in Nature, and ſo <hi>ordinary</hi> as is implied in this <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak not here of thoſe <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subterraneal Gulphs</hi> which ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors tell of, and our Seamen confirm to us, as that on the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> called the <hi>Malſtrondt,</hi> and another at the bottom of the <hi>Baltick Sea;</hi> where the Water runs with a mighty ſtream into the Earth. by which ſome ſhips (they ſay) have been ſwallowed up; nor yet of the Subterraneal Paſſages that are ſuppoſed to be betwixt ſome Seas in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:99554:174"/>I mentioned in my Book of the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If the Seas were ſo perforated, and that the Water ſhould paſs ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through the Holes, as it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily do, to give being to ſo many Springs, there would be found Suctions in the Sea, whereby Ships (eſpecially ſmall Veſſels) would be in conſtant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; which we hear not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Moreover it ſeems to be <hi>repugnant to Reaſon,</hi> and our <hi>Obſervations at Land;</hi> for the motion of the Sea in the Conſtant Circulation of the Tides, and alſo from Wind and Storms, would be in danger to ſtop up the Holes, by waſhing Earth into them, and ſo choak up the Channels and conſequently the Springs: As we ſee in the Roads, where ſometimes we meet with dangerous Holes in the Latches; if there happen a Spowt of Rain, ſo that the Water run in a ſtream but a day or two over thoſe Latches, the holes are cloſed up and they become paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble and firm.</p>
            <p>Another Branch of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> his Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is this, <hi>That there are Subterraneal Channels</hi> (or Rivers as <hi>Kircherus</hi> has it) <hi>whereby the Salt Water is conveyed to the</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:99554:175"/>Hydrophylacia, <hi>or Ciſterns,</hi> &amp;c. — This I cannot in his Senſe grant, becauſe they appear not: For never did any that dig in Mines either near the Sea, as at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> in the Coal-Pits; or farther off at Land, as in the Lead, Iron, or Tin-Mines, make any reports of Streams of Salt Water that they meet withal, which they ſhould probably do, if this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> were true. They tell us indeed of ſwift Currents of Freſh Water that ſometimes they meet with, but not a word of Salt.</p>
            <p>Again, Thoſe Subterraneal Channels muſt be ſuppoſed to be ſometimes 2 or 300 miles long, even in a right line, nay perhaps ſo many thouſand in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents, where the middle parts of the Land are at that diſtance from the Sea, and have their durable Springs; and how many hundred or thouſand miles long muſt we ſuppoſe them to be, if theſe Channels have ſuch crooked turnings and windings, as the ſmall Rivolets have that we obſerve at land? I confeſs this ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my underſtanding how it can be.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This ſuppoſes multitudes of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99554:175"/>his <hi>Hydrophylacia</hi> or Ciſterns of Salt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in every Countrey, and thoſe of an immenſe Magnitude, which as yet never any man found, and is (in my weak Judgement) repugnant to Reaſon, for the Earth and Sea compreſſing on all ſides of this Terreſtrial Globe, ſhould make it a Solid Body, and ſuch as cannot admit of ſuch large <hi>Chaſmata</hi> or Vacuities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>This Water is forced up through thoſe long Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and from the Hydrophylacia to the Springs, by the weight of the Air, Clouds, Winds, Storms, and Tydes depreſſing upon the Surface of the Sea.</hi>— That the Air has a weight and may depreſs a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea I ſhall not queſtion; the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian Experiment</hi> evinces the Air to depreſs by its gravity, yet how the Winds, Storms, and Tides ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Depreſſion I ſee not, but that their motion being oblique, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder it; foraſmuch as it interrupts the motion of gravity, which is evermore in a right line towards the Center. But how it is poſſible that this depreſſion of all theſe upon the Sea ſhould hold ſo ſtrong
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99554:176"/>(which yet we diſcern is very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) as to force the Water through thoſe Subterraneal Channels ſo many ſcores, hundreds, or thouſands of miles long, and that by ſuch Crooked <hi>Meanders</hi> as we have reaſon to ſuſpect, I cannot conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed Mr.</hi> S. (P. 318) <hi>tells of a Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Engine like the Wine-Coopers Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which will by the preſſure of the Air force up Wine or Water into other Veſſels, that are at diſtance and on higher grounds, and he ſupoſes that after the ſame manner the preſſure of theſe upon the Sea, forces the Water through the Channels to the Springs on Hills or Heaths at diſtance.</hi> He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo 2 or 3 more Schemes, whereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make out the facility of the conveyance, but both the other, and theſe are all fetched out of <hi>Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>Mundus Subterraneus,</hi> where <hi>P.</hi> 230 and 231: the Reader may ſee them all.</p>
            <p>To theſe I ſhall ſay, they are only ſuch in <hi>Mente Machinantis,</hi> but here is no proof to make them out to be ſo in <hi>Mundi Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But laſtly, If the Springs ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99554:176"/>and abſurdities, to proceed from the Sea-Water, there would certainly appear ſome difference perceptible to the ſenſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that ſort of Spring-Water, that comes from this cauſe, and thoſe that aſſuredly (himſelf confeſſing) proceed from Rain, when yet we diſcern there is none at all. And how comes it to paſs that thoſe Springs (eſpecially ſuch as are near the Sea) have not after ſo many thouſand years as the World has continued, ſomewhat of ſaltneſs in them, and that the Channels are not tainted after ſo long time? Indeed Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us that the Sea-Water lays down its ſaltneſs in the Channels of the Earth, and ſo the Water runs freſh out of the Springs. — But did he not alſo ſay (in <hi>P.</hi> 54.) <hi>That the Salt of the Earth is conveyed through the Subterraneal Channels into the Sea, and that thence it has its Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its Minera from Foſſile Salt?</hi> Now how the ſame Channels ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Salt to the Sea, and alſo drain the Seas Water from its Salt, and become Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of contrary Streams, I cannot recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to my Reaſon.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, I find that this <hi>new and poſitive Theſis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> is but a <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99554:177"/>Hypotheſis,</hi> and ſo far as he has here endeavored to make it out, to have no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: and therefore I muſt adhere to my Opinion of Rain and Snow Water to be the Original of Springs, which ſtill farther I can defend with more Arguments of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; but thoſe I ſhall wave till I have further occaſion.</p>
            <p>I confeſs this is an abſtruſe point in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and difficult to determine upon; But difficulty in finding ſhould not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us from ſeeking, but rather whet us on to more diligence in ſearching; ſo as whatever our Opinions are in things of this Nature, provided we aſſent or diſſent according to reaſon, and with readineſs to ſubmit when our reaſon ſhall be convinced, we are out of all danger of Hereſie, though perhaps we may be ſubject to error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had here thought to have entertained the Kind Reader with ſome Animadverſions upon another (ſmall) Book of</hi> Mr. Simpſons <hi>called</hi> Zenexton Antipeſtilentiale, <hi>where there are many things worth obſerving, and that may merita Comment; but this having far exceeded what at firſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I ſhall reſpit it till a further provocation, being alſo deſirous to continue on the defenſive hand, and ſo at preſent I bid Farewel.</hi>
